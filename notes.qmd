1. ⭐ Final Three-Layer Terminology Framework (APSR-Ready)

This framework resolves all ambiguity and aligns causal, conceptual, and statistical terminology.

Layer 1 — Partisan Type (Treatment Variable)

Describes how a respondent is partisan.

Explicit Partisan: subjective attachment to a party

Implicit Partisan: vote intention/choice but no attachment

None: no attachment and no vote intention/choice

In causal analyses, the estimand is defined only for:

S={i:Ti∈{0,1}}
S={i:T
i
	​

∈{0,1}}

Notation:

Ti=1
T
i
	​

=1: Explicit

Ti=0
T
i
	​

=0: Implicit

Ti=None
T
i
	​

=None: Excluded from causal model

Layer 2 — Partisan Anchor (Party Identity of Respondent)

Defines to which party the respondent belongs.

The respondent’s party of reference, determined by attachment (explicit) or vote intention/choice (implicit).

Notation:

Ai∈{1,…,P}if Ti∈{0,1}
A
i
	​

∈{1,…,P}if T
i
	​

∈{0,1}

Respondents with 
Ti=None
T
i
	​

=None have no valid anchor and are excluded from causal analysis.

Layer 3 — Partisan Relationship Category (Profile–Respondent Relationship)

Defines how the conjoint profile’s party affiliation relates to the respondent’s anchor.

Co-partisan (profile’s party = 
Ai
A
i
	​

)

Out-partisan (profile’s party ≠ 
Ai
A
i
	​

, but is a party in the system)

Non-partisan (profile displays no party)

Notation:

Rij=f(Ai,Zj)∈{Co,Out,Non}
R
ij
	​

=f(A
i
	​

,Z
j
	​

)∈{Co,Out,Non}

This variable is undefined for respondents with None.

Short Explanatory Text (use in Methods)

The treatment, Partisan Type (
Ti
T
i
	​

), determines whether a respondent’s political alignment is explicit or implicit. For respondents with a well-defined partisan identity (
Ti∈{0,1}
T
i
	​

∈{0,1}), this yields a Partisan Anchor (
Ai
A
i
	​

). The conjoint profile provides a party cue (
Zj
Z
j
	​

), which jointly with 
Ai
A
i
	​

 defines the Partisan Relationship Category (
Rij
R
ij
	​

): co-partisan, out-partisan, or non-partisan. Token allocation (
Yijr
Y
ijr
	​

) is causally downstream of both 
Ti
T
i
	​

 and 
Rij
R
ij
	​

, conditional on covariates and random effects.

4. ⭐ APSR-Ready Rewrite: Theory (only the relevant part)

Partisanship in multi-party systems exhibits two analytically distinct dimensions. The first concerns the type of partisanship a respondent expresses. Some respondents report subjective closeness to a party (explicit partisans), while others report a vote intention or choice in the absence of attachment (implicit partisans). These categories capture different modes of group commitment and are comparable to the distinction between psychological partisanship and expressive alignment.

The second dimension concerns which party a respondent aligns with. All explicit and implicit partisans possess a partisan anchor, the specific party they either feel attached to or intend to support. This yields meaningful within-country heterogeneity because explicit and implicit partisans tend to affiliate with systematically different parties across Europe.

In behavioral tasks where respondents evaluate political out-parties, these two dimensions jointly shape responses. The party displayed in the conjoint profile is matched to the respondent’s anchor to generate a partisan relationship category—co-partisan, out-partisan, or non-partisan—which structure how respondents allocate social and political resources to others.

This tripartite conceptual framework allows us to separate the effect of how respondents are partisan (explicit vs. implicit) from to which party they belong and how the evaluated profile relates to that party. Existing studies typically collapse these distinctions, which risks introducing systematic bias in cross-national work where the prevalence of explicit partisans varies widely. We theorize that explicit partisanship increases affective polarization by strengthening social identity commitment, yielding distinct predictions regarding in-group favoritism and out-group derogation.

5. ⭐ APSR-Ready Rewrite: Research Design (core explanatory paragraphs)
Sampling and Definition of Analytic Population

Respondents fall into three categories: explicit partisans (who report subjective attachment), implicit partisans (who report vote intention or choice but no attachment), and non-partisans (neither attachment nor vote reporting). Because affective polarization necessarily requires a party anchor to classify co-, out-, or non-partisan profiles, the causal estimand is defined only for respondents with an anchor, i.e. explicit and implicit partisans. Across countries, this analytic population comprises approximately 75–95 percent of respondents. We show in Appendix Figure X that the share of non-partisans varies only modestly across countries and does not correlate systematically with affective polarization outcomes.*

Treatment Definition

The treatment is Partisan Type (
Ti
T
i
	​

), indicating whether respondent 
i
i is an explicit (
Ti=1
T
i
	​

=1) or implicit (
Ti=0
T
i
	​

=0) partisan. This classification precedes the conjoint task.

Constructing the Partisan Anchor

Each respondent in the analytic sample has a Partisan Anchor (
Ai
A
i
	​

), defined as the specific party to which they report attachment (explicit) or which they intend to support (implicit). Anchors vary across respondents within parties and across countries.

Conjoint Design and Partisan Relationship Category

Each conjoint profile contains a party cue (
Zj
Z
j
	​

). For each respondent–profile pair, we generate the Partisan Relationship Category:

Co-partisan if 
Zj=Ai
Z
j
	​

=A
i
	​


Out-partisan if 
Zj≠Ai
Z
j
	​


=A
i
	​

, but 
Zj
Z
j
	​

 is a party

Non-partisan if the profile displays no party

This mapping is mechanical and identical across respondents and countries.
