We term identifiers, non-identifiers, and non-partisans.


## Roadmap

This study examines variation in affective polarization (AP) along **three analytically distinct dimensions**:

1. **Operationalization of partisanship**  
   Ingroup defined via **explicit partisan attachment** (identity-based) versus **vote intention/choice** (behavioral anchoring)

2. **Measurement of polarization**  
   **Attitudinal polarization** (thermometer-based measures) versus **behavioral polarization** (conjoint outcomes)

3. **External validity and scope conditions**  
   Cross-national variation in the prevalence and distribution of partisan types across European democracies

## Empirical strategy

### 1. Aggregate (European-level) patterns

First, we establish **European-level benchmarks** of affective polarization, conditioning on **partisan status** and **measurement strategy**.

- Outcome: Affective polarization  
- X-axis: Magnitude of AP  
- Y-axis: Measurement type (API, Wagner MD, CJ-based AP)  
- Shape / color: Partisan type (explicit partisan, implicit partisan, nonpartisan)

**Measurement logic**:

- **API and CJ-based AP** rely on *identity-based ingroup–outgroup definitions* and allow direct comparison between **attitudinal** and **behavioral** polarization.
- **Wagner’s measures** capture *perceived system-level affective differentiation* and uniquely allow inclusion of **nonpartisans**, providing a non-partisan baseline against which partisan polarization can be evaluated.

This step clarifies whether differences across partisan types reflect:
- ingroup bias,
- behavioral discrimination,
- or broader differences in perceived affective structure.

### 2. Comparative analysis: cross-national variation

Second, we examine how these patterns **vary across countries**.

- Compare the magnitude and dispersion of AP by partisan type within countries  
- Assess whether identity-based and system-level polarization align or diverge cross-nationally  
- Evaluate how the **distribution of partisan types** conditions observed levels of affective polarization

This step establishes the **external validity** of the individual-level findings and identifies contextual heterogeneity across European party systems.

## Data

We use data from @hahm2024divided.

## Limitations

Our findings remain limited due to the cross-national nature of our data.

### Experimental setup {.appendix}

Before the behavioral games, @hahm2024divided presented respondents a short background information overview and instructions. For the dictator game, these were: *This game is played by pairs of individuals.* *Each pair is made up of a Player 1 and a Player 2.* *Each player will have some information about the other player, but you will not be told who the other players are during or after the experiment.* *The game is conducted as follows: A sum of 10 tokens will be provisionally allocated to Player 1 at the start of each round.* *Player 1 will then decide how much of the 10 tokens to offer to Player 2.* *Player 1 could give some, all, or none of the 10 tokens.* *Player 1 keeps all tokens not given to Player 2.* *Player 2 gets to keep all the tokens Player 1 offers.* *You will play this game three times with three different people.* In the trust game, the provided information and instruction were: *This game is played by pairs of individuals.* *Each pair is made up of a Player 1 and a Player 2.* *Each player will have some information about the other player, but you will not be told who the other players are during or after the experiment.* *Each player will receive 10 tokens.* *Player 1 then has the opportunity to give a portion of his or her 10 tokens to Player 2.* *Player 1 could give some, all, or none of the 10 tokens.* *Whatever amount Player 1 decides to give to Player 2 will be tripled before it is passed on to Player 2.* *Player 2 then has the option of returning any portion of this tripled amount to Player 1.* *Then, the game is over.* *Player 1 receives whatever he or she keeps from the original 10 tokens, plus anything returned to him or her by Player 2. Player 2 receives their original 10 tokens, plus whatever he or she keeps after returning any portion of the tripled amount to Player 1.* *You will play this game three times, with three different people.* *The more tokens you obtain, the more successful you will be.*

In both games respondents were shown a tabular overview of Player 2 after the instructions. @fig-example-profile shows an example of such a profile along with the interface respondents were provided to assign the 10 tokens. Each round, a new profile was displayed to respondents.
