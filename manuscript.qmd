  How does partisan type influence affective polarization?

  A comparative study of 25 European democracies
abstract: |
  This study introduces the concept of partisan *type*, which distinguishies *explicit* partisans -- respondents who explicitly report attachement to a political party -- from *implicit* partisans, namely respondents who explicitly report no attachement, but still express a partisan preference in standard voting items.
  Existing studies on affective polarization often use measures that restrict analyses to either type trying to infer the state of affective polarization in a given context.
  This study explores systematic differences between explicit and implicit partisans regarding their affective polarization behavior, reanalyzing experimental data from 25 European multi-party systems.
  Results show that 1) shares of explicit partisans vary from 45% to 85%,
  2) implicit partisans show almost identical levels of affective polarization,
  3) lower levels of IF and OD
  4) this holds across countries.
  The implications are that scholars need to carefully consider what their population of interest is when measuring affective polarization, as context-specific differences in the relative distributions of partisan types may yield biased inferences about the state or dynamic of polarization in a given society.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

How does partisan type influence affective polariztion? 
While the past decade witnessed a sharp increase in publications dedicated to study the causes, consequences, and dynamics of affective polarization, there still remains much ambiguity when it comes to conceptualization and measurement.
Notably, some conceptual or measurement approaches limit their scope to only a partisan subset of the sample, while other strategies cover a wider range of the sampled electorate.
Nevertheless, the goal is often times identical: infer about the state or change of affective polarization in a given country's society.
If however such inferences are based on partisan subsets, inferring statements about that subset to the whole population rest on assumptions about the distribution of that subset in the population.
In other words, only if the partisan subset a) is large enough to constitute a (sufficiently) large part of the population or b) is representative of that population, one can validly infer from the subsample to the population.

This study aims to address this gap and contribute to the affective polarization literature in multiple ways.
First, I introduce the concept of *partisan type* to analytically distinguish between *explicit* and *implicit partisans*, enabling affective polarization scholars to better clarify what their sample of study and population of interest is.
Second, I empirically investigate the relative distributions of partisan types across 25 European multi-party system, finding cross-national variation in the relative shares but surprising consistencies regarding the overall numbers of partisans.
Third, I employ a causal identification strategy using hierarchical bayesian modelling to approach an answer to the question:
How would a hypothetical intervention changing a respondent's partisan type impact her affective polarization behavior, holding all other covariates constant?
Finally, I put things in a comparative perspective by studying cross-national variation in the hypothesized relationship between partisan type and affective polarization outcomes.

From a theoretical perspective, affective polarization emphasizes individuals' identities, their subjective feelings of belonging to a perceived group and the corresponding, emotional, *affective*, mechanisms that subconsciously influence human intergroup behaviors.
Hence, through this social identity perspective, we expect *explicit* partisan types to show stronger levels of affective polarization.
The rationale is that explicit reporting of feelt attachement corresponds to stronger group identites,

## Theory {#sec-theory}

## Literature Review

### Origins of Affective Polarization
Affective polarization emerged as a concept to capture interpersonal animus between supporters of different political groups rather than ideological distance.  
Early scholarship linked partisan feeling thermometers and social distance items to interpersonal evaluations and highlighted that group-based affective reactions can diverge from programmatic preferences.  
This work emphasized that affective polarization reflects a social-psychological process rooted in group identity, not an ideological cleavage.  
Subsequent research clarified that affective polarization can exist independently of policy disagreement, thereby redefining what it means for electorates to be “polarized.”  
Together, these contributions established affective polarization as a phenomenon driven by intergroup attitudes grounded in social identity processes rather than by substantive issue conflict.

### Mechanisms of Affective Polarization
Scholars have identified multiple mechanisms that generate affective polarization, including partisan social identity, motivated reasoning, and negative partisanship.  
Partisan identity operates as a salient social category that triggers ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation.  
Motivated reasoning leads individuals to interpret information through a partisan lens, reinforcing existing affective biases.  
Negative partisanship posits that citizens are often driven more strongly by hostility toward outgroups than by affinity toward ingroups.  
These mechanisms jointly suggest that affective polarization is sustained by both positive and negative identity-based evaluations rather than by ideological disagreement alone.

### Consequences of Affective Polarization
Affective polarization is associated with a wide range of behavioral and attitudinal consequences that threaten democratic functioning.  
Research shows that high levels of animus reduce social trust, undermine support for democratic norms, and increase willingness to discriminate against political opponents.  
Affective polarization also contributes to biased information processing, selective exposure, and the erosion of cross-partisan cooperation.  
In institutional settings, affective polarization can exacerbate elite conflict and decrease voters’ willingness to accept electoral outcomes.  
These consequences demonstrate that affective polarization has profound implications for both democratic stability and interpersonal relations.

### Measurement and Multidimensionality
The measurement of affective polarization remains contested, particularly regarding the components that make up partisan affect.  
Standard approaches rely on feeling thermometers to capture warmth toward ingroups and outgroups, yet these measures only approximate the rich structure of partisan identities.  
Recent work argues that affective polarization consists of at least two analytically distinct dimensions: ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation.  
This distinction matters because increases in one dimension need not imply increases in the other, complicating empirical comparisons.  
Scholars increasingly recognize that measurement strategies must reflect this multidimensionality to avoid misleading conclusions about the extent and nature of affective polarization.

### Affective Polarization in Multiparty and Comparative Contexts
Applying affective polarization concepts to multiparty systems introduces additional conceptual and empirical challenges.  
Unlike two-party systems, multiparty contexts require identifying which partisan relationships matter, which outgroups are salient, and how partisan identity functions when party attachments vary in strength.  
Comparative studies must account for the distribution of explicit and implicit partisans across countries, as relying only on explicit identifiers risks systematic bias.  
If explicit partisans are more polarized than implicit ones, cross-national samples with different proportions of explicit partisans yield incomparable estimates of polarization.  
These challenges highlight that comparative affective polarization research requires careful conceptualization of the population of partisans under study.

## Argument

### Partisanship as Identity
Partisanship functions as a social identity that organizes how individuals evaluate political groups and their supporters.  
Explicit partisanship reflects a conscious and self-reported attachment to a party, signaling a clear sense of group belonging.  
Implicit partisanship, by contrast, arises from habitual voting behavior or stable preferences without a consciously held identity.  
These distinctions matter because group identity drives emotional and evaluative responses toward political opponents.  
Recognizing variation in the strength and explicitness of partisan identity is therefore crucial for understanding heterogeneity in affective polarization.

### Explicit and Implicit Partisans
Explicit partisans exhibit strong, self-acknowledged attachments that activate social identity mechanisms such as ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation.  
Implicit partisans lack a conscious sense of belonging yet still display stable preferences consistent with partisan behavior.  
Explicit identifiers should therefore express stronger affective reactions because they anchor their political evaluations in group-based identity.  
Implicit identifiers, in contrast, approach politics more instrumentally or habitually and thus engage less in identity-based evaluative bias.  
Distinguishing explicit from implicit partisans allows researchers to explain variation in affective polarization within and across electorates.

### Comparative Measurement Problems
Cross-national analyses risk conflating differences in partisan identity composition with differences in affective polarization itself.  
Samples from countries with many explicit partisans will naturally exhibit higher levels of affective polarization if explicit identifiers are more polarized.  
Conversely, countries with many implicit partisans may appear less polarized even if underlying affective dynamics are similar.  
Failing to account for these compositional differences introduces systematic bias into comparative estimates.  
This issue underscores the need for conceptual clarity about which partisan subpopulations are being compared across contexts.

### Theoretical Mechanism
Social identity theory predicts that explicit partisans, who recognize and endorse their group membership, should show strong ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation.  
This explicit recognition activates intergroup comparison processes that heighten emotional and evaluative reactions.  
Implicit partisans, lacking conscious identification, do not engage in these processes to the same extent despite holding stable preferences.  
As a result, they should exhibit lower levels of affective polarization across all relevant dimensions.  
The distinction between explicit and implicit identifiers provides a theoretically grounded explanation for systematic heterogeneity in affective polarization.

### Hypotheses
**$H_1$:** Explicit partisans exhibit higher levels of affective polarization than implicit partisans.  
**$H_2$:** Explicit partisans exhibit stronger ingroup favoritism than implicit partisans.  
**$H_3$:** Explicit partisans exhibit stronger outgroup derogation than implicit partisans.  
Because affective polarization is composed of ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation, support for $H_1$ necessarily implies support for at least one of $H_2$ or $H_3$.  
These hypotheses jointly articulate the expected relationship between partisan identity type and the components of affective polarization.



### Literature review

The concept of Affective Polarization (AP), defined as the tendency for individuals to harbor positive feelings toward their own political group (in-group) while simoultaneously displaying antipathy, dislike, or distrust toward opposing groups (out-groups), has fundamentally reoriented the study of political conflict [@iyengar2019origins; @IyengarWagner2025Conceptualizing].
This research agenda emerged squarely within the United States following the seminal work by @iyengar2012affect.
Its immediate intellectual context was the decades-long scholarly dispute regarding the extent of polarization in the American mass public, which had primarily focused on whether voters were becoming ideologically extreme or mere "sorted" along partisan lines [see, e.g., the debates of @abramowitz2006exploring; @abramowitz2008ispolarization; @fiorina2006culture; @fiorina2008polarization; @fiorina2008political].
AP offered a distinct paradigm to the study of political polarization, prioritizing affect over policy preferences as the central metric of political division
[@IyengarWagner2025Conceptualizing].
Theoretically, AP is rooted in social identity (SIT) and self categorization theory (SCT) [@tajfel1971social; @tajfel1974social; @tajfel1979integrative; @tajfel1979integrativearticle], posing that partisan identification operates as a social identity sufficient to generate bias an in-group favoritism.

Scholars have identified several mechanisms and developments that contribute to partisan hostility, emphasizing the role of both political and non-political identity alignment.
AP has been found to be reinforced by ideological sorting [@levendusky2009partisan], elite polarization [@rogowski2016ideology; @webster2017ideological], negative campaigning [@iyengar2012affect; @sood2016coming; @martin2024neg], and the influence of partisan and digital media 
[@hobolt2024polarizing; @bail2018exposure; @boxell2024cross; @druckman2018no; @lelkes2017hostile; @levendusky2013partisan; @levy2021social; @prior2013media; @tornberg2022digital}
Recent evidence further suggests both policy disagreement and partisan identity independently drive interpersonal affect[@dias2022nature].
Crucially, AP is amplified by the social sorting of political identities, where partisan affiliation increasingly aligns with other social identities, intensifying group boundaries and conflict [@mason2015disrespectfully; @mason2016acrosscutting; @mason2018one; @mason2018uncivil; @harteveld2021ticking].
The consequences of AP are significant and widely considered detrimental to democratic stability [@TorcalHarteveld2025Introduction; @bakker2024putting; @bettarelli2023regional; @hobolt2024polarizing].
It is linked to the erosion of democratic norms [@kingzette2021affective; @svolik2019polarization; @graham2020democracy; @hetherington2020washington; but see @broockman2023doesaffective], decreased social trust [@TorcalStolleThomson2025SocialCohesion], increased discrimination beyond political contexts[@huber2017political; @mcconnell2018economic; @berntzen2023consequencesofaffective; @stoetzer2023affective], and heightened support for political violence [@kalmoe2022radicalamerican].

Conceptual refinements have evolved AP into a multidimensional concept, demanding careful consideration of its targets and measurement modalities [@campos2025new; @garzia2025affective; @wagner2024affectiveeurope]. Scholars distinguish between *Horizontal AP* --- antipathy between ordinary citizens --- and *Vertical AP* -- evaluations directed toward political parties as organizations or their leaders/elites [@rollicke2023polarisation; @areal2024verticalvshorizontal] @reiljan2024patterns.
These dimensions, while related, are empirically distinct; for instance, voters may hold more negative affect toward out-party elites than toward ordinary out-party voters.
Furthermore, measurement now encompasses attitudinal measures (e.g. feeling thermometers and social distance), behavioral measures (e.g., trust games), and implicit measures (e.g. IATs) to capture deeper psychological processes [@CarlinLove2025Measuring].

When adapting AP research from the American two-party system to the context of European multi-party systems, conceptual ambiguity surrounding the question of how to determine in- and out-group(s)[@bettarelli2023regional; @garzia2025affective; @wagner2021affective]. 
Adaptation strategies include defining AP as the difference between in-party feelings and the average feeling toward all out-partues [@reiljan2020fear], or adopting a less identity-bound approach that defines AP as the spread affect across the party system [@@wagner2021affective].
Comparative evidence confirms AP is widespread in European democracies, sometimes at levels comparable to or exceeding the U.S., though longitudinal trends are heterogeneous across countries [@garzia2023affective].
European AP is often structures by disagreements over cultural issues and strongly incluenced by the presence and rhetoric of populist parties, establishing a polarizing "populist vs anti-populist" affective dimension.
Institutional factors also play a moderating role, studies by @hahm2024divided, @wagner2024affective and @wagner2025elite find decreasing effects of coalition contexts on AP.

The study of Affective Polarization (AP) is fundamentally intertwined with the conceptual nature of Partisanship and Identity, forming the psychological micro-foundations of political conflict [@dias2022nature].
The enduring debate surrounding partisanship pits the Instrumental Model, which views party attachment as a rational "running tally" of policy and performance evaluations, against the Expressive Model, which defines partisanship as an enduring, affective, psychological identification with a political group [@huddy2017political].
The application of Social Identity Theory (SIT) has provided the crucial theoretical framework for the expressive model, transforming the somewhat vague concept of partisanship into a precise partisan identity that generates strong in-group bias and out-group derogation [@huddy2018expressive; @reiljan2021ideological].
This theoretical orientation necessitates a nuanced differentiation of partisan status in mass publics, leading to the introduction of partisan type [@elliott2024like].
Specifically, we distinguish between explicit partisans, who affirmatively report a psychological attachment or feeling of closeness to a political party, aligning closely with the psychological definition of identity, and implicit partisans (or "closeness partisans"), who express a consistent partisan preference (e.g., via vote intention or choice) but explicitly disclaim any formal attachment [this draws upon the work of @elliott2024like].

This explicit differentiation between partisan types exposes a salient methodological challenge in cross-national AP research concerning conceptualization and measurement ambiguity [@garzia2025affective].
Affective polarization measures must determine whether their population of interest is limited exclusively to declared partisans or encompasses the entire electorate [@garzia2023affective].
In multiparty systems (MPS), this distinction manifests in diverging methodological approaches: measures such as Reiljan's Affective Polarization Index (API) typically restrict calculations only to explicit partisans (or self-declared party identifiers/leaners) to maintain fidelity to the social identity framework's core premise of defined in-group attachment, while approaches such as those proposed by Wagner (e.g., Spread of Scores) often analyze the whole electorate, independent of reported partisan closeness.
Relying solely on explicit partisan subsamples creates substantial comparative risks.
The proportion of explicit partisans varies drastically across countries—ranging, for example, from lows around 45% to highs near 85% in European democracies—meaning comparative inferences are drawn from populations that differ significantly in size relative to the total electorate.
If, as generally expected by theory and empirical studies, explicit partisans exhibit systematically higher levels of affective polarization (both In-Group Favoritism and Out-Group Derogation) than implicit partisans, restricting analysis to this subset leads to a biased assessment.
Specifically, this practice risks overestimation of the aggregate polarization level in countries with low explicit partisan rates (e.g., a country with 50% explicit partisans) compared to those with high rates (e.g., 70% explicit partisans), thereby undermining the validity of cross-national conclusions about the true state or dynamics of polarization.
A clearer consideration of partisan type is therefore necessary to mitigate these systematic biases in comparative research.

The theoretical lens through which Affective Polarization (AP) is examined is intrinsically linked to the conceptual nature of Partisanship as an expressive social identity.
In contrast to the instrumental model, which posits partisanship as a mere "running tally" of rational policy evaluations, the expressive model defines partisanship as an enduring, affective psychological attachment to a political group.
This identity involves a subjective sense of belonging (self-categorization) that is internalized to varying degrees.
The variation in the strength and nature of this attachment is analytically captured through the distinction of partisan types.
We define explicit partisans as individuals who affirmatively report this subjective, psychological attachment or feeling of closeness to a political party.
This explicit self-categorization directly aligns with the fundamental premise of Social Identity Theory (SIT).
Conversely, implicit partisans are those who explicitly deny subjective attachment yet still express a consistent partisan preference, often observed through vote intention or choice.
While implicit partisans may possess underlying, pre-introspective associative identities that influence judgment, the key theoretical difference is the absence of declared subjective group identity, distinguishing them from the fully identified explicit group.
According to the established principles of Social Identity Theory, the psychological consequences of intergroup comparison—specifically in-group bias and out-group derogation—are fundamentally dependent on the strength and salience of the identity.
A stronger internalized sense of belonging (i.e., explicit attachment) generates an intensified motivation to protect and advance the party's status and maintain its "positive distinctiveness".
Affective Polarization, defined as the gap between in-group favoritism (IF) and out-group derogation (OD), should therefore be systematically amplified among those who have made an explicit psychological investment in the partisan identity.
Empirical evidence corroborates this mechanism, consistently showing that strongly identified partisans exhibit higher levels of AP and are more emotionally aroused by partisan threat than their weaker counterparts.
The commitment inherent in explicit partisanship should thus serve as a powerful moderator of intergroup affect, driving a greater polarization of feelings than is observed among implicit partisans who consciously reject the identity component.
This expectation motivates our core hypotheses: 
H1​: Explicit partisans exhibit higher levels of affective polarization than implicit partisans. 
H2​: Explicit partisans exhibit higher levels of in-group favoritism than implicit partisans. 
H3​: Explicit partisans exhibit higher levels of out-group derogation than implicit partisans. 
Given that AP is derived jointly from IF and OD, the validation of H1​ necessitates the validation of H2​ or H3​ (or both).
Based on the theory that strong partisan identity elevates both positive emotional attachment and negative emotional responses to opposition, we hypothesize specifically that: H2′​: Explicit partisans exhibit both more in-group favoritism and more out-group derogation than implicit partisans.

### Lit Review

Aff Pol -> What is it and where it comes from (literature)
-> polarization as static presence of bi- or multi-modal distributions
-> polarization as dynamic increase 
both make sense, I focus on first

Aff Pol -> what are causes, consequences, and dynamics (state of research)

aff pol closely related to partisanship and identity, but what is partisanship, what is identity?
-> literature on partisanship
-> introducing partisan type

Aff Pol Measurement/Conceptual ambiguities (problems)
-> often no clear definition of partisan type

Aff Pol ambiguities in Multiparty Systems/Comparative analyses specifically and recent trends (problems in comparative research)
-> not clearly defining partisan type that is being studied poses comparative risks
-> e.g. if in country A 70% explicit partisans but country B 50% explicit partisans
-> using explicit partisan subsamples alone, inference over state of polarization in country A and country B differing (worse for latter / prone to bias)
-> if, e.g., explicit partisans are systematically higher polarized -> overestimation of country Bs polarization level

### Argument

Concept of partisan type, distinguishing implicit and explicit partisan types, useful for addressing abiguities regarding subsamples and populations of interest.

Social identity theory: explicit types -> reported attachement (subjective belonging) -> indicates group identity -> higher ingroup outgroup mechanism

implicit ones: explicitly report no attachement -> no direct/conscious group attachement -> expressive group preference nevertheless through vote variables -> less polarization

-> HTs
Hypotheses:

$H_1$: Explicit partisans exhibit higher levels of affective polarization than implicit partisans.

$H_2$: Explicit partisans exhibit higher levels of ingroup favoritism than implicit partisans.

$H_3$: Explicit partisans exhibit higher levels of outgroup derogation than implicit partisans.

Note that these hypotheses are logically dependent: As ingroup favoritsm and outgroup derogation are two subcomponents that jointly make up affective polarization, if $H_1$ were true, either $H_2$ or $H_3$ or both have to be true by extension.

$H_2$: Explicit partisans exhibit both more ingroup favoritsm and more outgroup derogation than implicit partisans.

depending on literature, additional comparative hypothesis


## Research design {#sec-design}

- Data and experimental setup -> waves and survey items -> hierarchical data structure
- Variables -> DAG -> tripartite structure -> recapture hierarchical structure
- Causal Assumptions
- Model -> recapture hierarchical structure -> cross level interaction
- Control Variables? Priors
- Quantities of Interest: CATE AP, IG, OD

This section outlines how we measure affective polarization and its subcomponents, the data we use, and out empirical strategy to estimate the effect of explicit partisanship on our outcomes of interest: affective polarization, ingroup favoritism, and outgroup derogation.

We conceptually frame explicit partisanship as a treatment and implicit partisanship as a control. That is, respondents reporting a subjective attachement to a political party ($T_i = 1$) form the treated group, whereas respondents expressing vote choice without attachement ($T_i = 0) form the comparison group.[^omit-quasi]

[^omit-quasi]: For readability, we omit the prefix "quasi-" when referring to treatment and control, but this does not imply random assignement. Our design remains observational.

The underlying research question is: Does explicit partisan attachement amplify affective polarization relative to implicit partisan attachement?

To approximate causal inference from observational variation, we exploit the following features of the data:

1. Tripartite structure of partisan and profile relationships. Each respondent $i$ is characterized by their *partisan type* ($T_i$) and a *partisan anchor* ($A_i$), which is either the party they feel attached to (explicit partisans, $T_i = 1$) or intend to vote for (implicit partisans, $T_i = 0$). Each conjoint profile presents a party cue ($Z^{party}_{ri}$), which is compared to the respondent's anchor to classify the profile as co-partisan, out-partisan, or neutral ($R_{ri} \in {Co, Out, None}$). This structure separates treatment assignment, i.e., partisan type ($T_i$), respondent identity, i.e., partisan anchor ($A_i$), and profile-level variation ($R_ri$).
2. Randomized conjoint profiles. The profiles' attributes -- including all non-partusab cues $Z^{other}_{ri}$ -- are randomly assigned. This ensures that observed differences in token allocations across $R_ri$ are attributable to profile characteristics rather than respondent selection.
3. Hierarchical variation. Respondents are nested within partisan anchors, which are themselves nested within countries. This allows for multilevel modeling that captures heterogeneity at the respondent, party, and country level.

{{< embed code/02_descr_anal.qmd#fig-dag >}}

In this section, we situate our measurement approach of affective polarization, present the used data and out empirical strategie to approximate an isolation of the causal effect of *explicit* partisanship on our outcomes of interest: affective polarization, ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation.

In causal terminology, explicit partisans form our treatment group ($T = 1$), with implicit partisans constituting our control group ($T = 0$).[^1]

The underlying idea is to study the effect of explicit subjective group attachement compared to implicit group attachement on affective polarization. 



The effect of the partisan-group-relative-variable is conditional on the type of partisanship. The partisan-group-relative-variable is itself a function of assigned partisan ingroup of respondents (by attachement for explicit and by vote intention/choice for implicit) and the displayed party affiliation of the conjoint profile.

Respondents vary along two analytically distinct dimensions. First, the partisan type ($T_i$) distinguishes respondents who report subjective partisan attachment (explicit partisans, $T_i=1$) from those who report a vote intention or choice in the absence of attachment (implicit partisans, $T_i = 0$). Second, each respondent is assigned a partisan anchor ($A_i$), defined as the party to which they report either attachment or vote intention. In the conjoint tasks, the party cue of profile $j$ is compared to anchor $A_i$ to generate a partisan relationship category ($R_{ij}∈\{Co,Out,Non\}$). This tripartite structure cleanly separates treatment status, party identity, and respondent–profile relationships, and it allows us to estimate the conditional effect of explicit partisan attachment across parties and countries using a hierarchical model with random effects for respondents, parties, and countries.

### Data {#sec-data}

We analyze data from @hahm2024divided ...

### Variables

Following our theoretical framework outlined before, we now operationalize our main variables.

Our main variable of interest is $T_i = \{1, 0\}$, which denotes the *partisan type* of respondent $i$. Values of $T_i = 1$ indicate explicit partisan type, i.e., respondents who reported a feeling of attachement to any political party. $T_i = 0$ marks implicit partisan types: respondents who actively reported not feeling attached to a political party, but expressed a party preference through a vote choice or intention variable.

Next, each respondent is assigned a *partisan anchor* ($A_i$), namely the party respondents indicated to feel attached to or has (intended to) voted for.

We use $Z_ri$ to denote the conjoint profile's cue presented in round $r$ to respondent $i$. These cues include dimension party, age, class, gender, religion, nationality and in case of the dictator game an EU attachement. $Z^{party}_{ri}$ marks the partisan cue, $Z^{other}_{ri}$ all other conjoint cues.

Given we are interested in the partisan effects, we limit observations to conjoint profiles with the nationality attribute fixed to that of the respective country (i.e., "co-national" from respondents' point of view), since there was never a partisan cue for outnationals to exclude implausible scenarios.

Figure X displays the causal data-generating structure. Respondents possess a partisan anchor $A$, defined as the party they feel close to (explicit partisans) or intend to vote for (implicit partisans). Partisan type $T$ (explicit vs. implicit) is only defined for respondents with a partisan anchor and is therefore a child node of $A$. The conjoint design randomizes all profile attributes. The partisan cue $Z^{party} combines with $A$ to produce the partisan relationship category $R=f(A,Z^{party})$, which determines whether the profile is interpreted as co-partisan, out-partisan, or neutral. Other randomized profile cues $Z^{other}$ affect the outcome directly. Token allocations $Y$ are affected by both $R$ and $Z^{other}$, with the effect of $R$ theorized to be conditional on $T$. Because $T$ is observational, we cannot assume conditional independence a priori, hence $C$ denotes potential confounders of both $T$ and $Y$.

To interpret the path $T \rightarrow R \rightarrow Y$ as the conditional causal effect of $T$, we must establish the following assumptions:

SUTVA -> Treatment outcomes are independent of treatment assignment to other units Y_i(1), Y_i(0)
Conditional Independence -> No confounders influencing T and Y
Covariate Balance -> $E[X \mid T = 1] = E[X \mid T = 0]$ Comparability of T=1 and T=0 
Common Support -> for every respondent, there is a positive probability of being assigned to both the treatment and control groups (fulfilled by subset to respondents with partisan anchor)

### Independent variables {#sec-iv}

We code...

Partisanship

$T = 1$ -> explicit partisanship
$T = 0$ -> implicit partisanship



### Dependent variable {#sec-dv}

Token allocated in the experiment

$Y$

### Control variables {#sec-controls}

Given the observational and non-random assignmend of $T_{i}$, including any potential confounding covariates is crucial to ensure comparability across the treatment levels $T_i \in {1, 0}$ and to block backdoor paths that jointly influence partisan type $T$ and token allocations $Y$.

Although the goal of completely including all covariates is untestable, we try to include as many relevant covariates as possible, given the numerous studies on partisanship.

Given the observational nature of the partisan type variable (Ti​), we employ a comprehensive set of control variables (Ci​) to fulfill the Conditional Independence Assumption and minimize confounding. This set includes standard demographic and socioeconomic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, education, economic perception), core ideological positions (Left-Right, EU position, nativism), and specific psychological traits. Critically, we include a detailed battery of items measuring Anti-System and Populist Attitudes alongside general political efficacy. This rigorous control strategy ensures we isolate the treatment effect—the conditioning impact of explicit subjective attachment on affective polarization—from alternative explanations driven by generalized political engagement or anti-establishment resentment common to the implicit partisan group.

Because the inclusion of that many covariates reduces the amount of observations due to noise and missing values in the data, I estimate a base model with only experimental controls and a covariate model, which includes the above mentioned variables. The purpose is to ensure substantive interpretation is not sensitive on differing datasets depending on the covariate specification. On the other hand, the inclusion of this many covariates aims at blocking any backdoor paths between Z and Y, accounting for selection effects of Z and consequently improving the comparability between treatment groups. 

I include all covariates for which the number of NAs is < 10000.

### Causal model

Partisan Type -> Partisan Anchor -> Relationship Category -> Allocation

### Statistical model

The unit of analysis is the conjoint round $r$, i.e., the evaluation of a single conjoint profile within one game. Each profile evaluation $r$ is nested within respondent $i$, who is nested within a partisan anchor $a$ (the respondent’s party of attachment or vote intention), which is nested within country $c$. This yields a four-level hierarchical data structure:  
**Level 1:** profile evaluations ($r$) →  
**Level 2:** respondents ($i$) →  
**Level 3:** partisan anchors ($a$) →  
**Level 4:** countries ($c$).

Respondents vary along two analytically distinct dimensions. First, partisan type $T_i$ differentiates respondents who report subjective partisan attachment (explicit partisans, $T_i = 1$) from those who report a vote intention or vote choice without attachment (implicit partisans, $T_i = 0$). Second, each respondent is assigned a partisan anchor $A_i$, defined as the specific party to which they report either attachment (explicit partisans) or vote intention (implicit partisans).

In each conjoint round $r$ the party cue displayed in the profile is compared to the respondent’s partisan anchor $A_i$ to generate a partisan relationship category $R_{ri} \in \{\text{Co}, \text{Out}, \text{None}\}$. This tripartite structure—partisan type, partisan anchor, and respondent–profile relationship—separates (1) treatment status, (2) party identity, and (3) relational meaning of the cue and allows estimation of how explicit partisan attachment conditions sensitivity to partisan cues across respondents, parties, and countries.

Let $Y_{riac}$ denote the number of tokens allocated by respondent $i$ (nested in partisan anchor $a$ and country $c$) in conjoint round $r$. To estimate how explicit partisan type ($T_i = 1$) modifies the effect of the partisan relationship cue ($R_{ri}$) we specify the following multilevel model:

$$

Key differences to the earlier draft are that respondents enter the model only with a random intercept $u_{i0}$ (no respondent-level random slope for $R_{ri}$). Initially we attempted to estimate a respondent-level random slope for $R_{ri}$, but within-respondent variation in the partisan-relationship variable was too limited to support a reliable estimate; consequently the final estimated specification contains respondent intercepts only and random slopes for $R_{ri}$ (and $T_i$) at the partisan-anchor and country levels.

Random effects are modeled as multivariate normal with correlated intercepts and slopes at the partisan-anchor and country levels:

$$
u_{i0} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{u0}),
$$

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
v_{a0} \\ v_{aT} \\ v_{aR}
\end{pmatrix}
\sim
\mathcal{N}\!\left(
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix},
\Sigma_a
\right),
$$

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
w_{c0} \\ w_{cT} \\ w_{cR}
\end{pmatrix}
\sim
\mathcal{N}\!\left(
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix},
\Sigma_c
\right),
$$

$$
\varepsilon_{riac} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2).
$$

Both $\Sigma_a$ and $\Sigma_c$ are full $3 \times 3$ covariance matrices, so intercepts and slopes are estimated as correlated at the partisan-anchor and country levels. This mirrors the model code where the random terms for country and for partisan-anchor-within-country are specified as correlated intercepts and slopes.

#### Model structure and justification

**Cross-level interaction of substantive interest.**  
The main theoretical question is whether explicit partisan attachment ($T_i = 1$) alters responsiveness to co-, out-, and neutral partisan cues ($R_{ri}$). The fixed-effect interaction $\beta_3 (T_i \times R_{ri})$ estimates this conditional effect at the population (grand-mean) level.

**Random slopes for higher-level variation in cue sensitivity.**  
The effect of the Level-1 cue $R_{ri}$ is allowed to vary across partisan anchors and across countries (random slopes $v_{aR}$ and $w_{cR}$), which captures heterogeneity in cue sensitivity that is plausibly organized by party identity and national political context. Similarly, the Level-2 treatment $T_i$ is allowed to vary across anchors and countries (random slopes $v_{aT}$ and $w_{cT}$), reflecting that the meaning and strength of explicit partisanship differ across parties and national settings.

**Respondent-level variation and identification.**  
Respondents vary in baseline generosity and provide multiple conjoint rounds; this is modeled with a respondent random intercept $u_{i0}$. We did not include a respondent-level random slope for $R_{ri}$ because there is insufficient within-respondent variation in the relationship variable to estimate it reliably. Put differently, many respondents do not experience enough co/out/none combinations across rounds for stable respondent-specific slope estimates. Omitting a respondent-level slope implies that heterogeneity in cue sensitivity is captured at the partisan-anchor and country levels rather than at the individual level.

**Implications of omitting respondent-level random slopes.**  
Omitting $u_{iR}$ means the model does not estimate idiosyncratic respondent-level deviations from the average relationship effect. If relevant individual-level heterogeneity were present but unmodeled, the estimated higher-level variances (in $\Sigma_a$ and $\Sigma_c$) or residual variance could absorb some of that heterogeneity. Given the data limitation (low within-respondent variation), estimating $u_{iR}$ would be poorly identified and could destabilize inference; the chosen specification therefore balances theoretical desiderata and empirical identifiability.

**Correlated random effects and partial pooling.**  
Correlated intercepts and slopes at the anchor and country levels allow partial pooling of treatment and cue effects, borrowing strength across units while permitting systematic contextual differences. This stabilizes estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects and aligns with the hypothesis that both party identity and national context shape partisan cue effects.

**Estimation.**  
Models were estimated in a Bayesian framework (via *brms*), which propagates uncertainty through the multilevel interaction structure and regularizes the maximal random-effects specification through priors.

In sum, the estimated model aligns the theoretical structure of partisan cue processing with a multilevel design that  
(i) treats explicit partisanship as a Level-2 treatment whose effect can vary across parties and countries,  
(ii) captures heterogeneity in cue sensitivity at the partisan-anchor and country levels, and  
(iii) models respondent-level repeated measures via random intercepts while avoiding poorly identified respondent-level random slopes given the observed within-respondent variation.


#### Prior specification

- **Approach 1 — Very Weakly Informative Priors (`normal(0, 5)`)**

This approach aims to be conservative, broad, and minimally informative.

**Rationale**

- Token allocations range from **0–10**, so any plausible effect of a predictor—main or interaction—must lie within approximately **–10 to +10**.  
- A `Normal(0, 5)` prior places ~95% of its probability mass within this range (≈ ±9.8).  
- This reflects no strong prior beliefs about the size or direction of effects while permitting large shifts if supported by the data.

**Specification**

- **Fixed effects (slopes & interactions):**  
  - \( \beta_k \sim \text{Normal}(0, 5) \)

- **Intercept:**  
  - \( \text{Intercept} \sim \text{Normal}(5, 5) \)  
    (midpoint of 0–10 with substantial uncertainty)

- **Random effect SDs:**  
  - \( \sigma_{\text{RE}} \sim \text{Student-t}(3, 0, 5) \)

- **Residual SD:**  
  - \( \sigma \sim \text{Student-t}(3, 0, 5) \)

**Characteristics**

- Extremely permissive (barely regularizing).  
- Useful when the goal is **maximal conservatism** and **minimal prior influence**.  
- May yield wider posteriors, more computation difficulty, and greater risk of overfitting with many random effects.

- **Approach 2 — Weakly Informative, Regularizing Priors (recommended)**

Aimed at *constrain-but-not-restrict* modeling: improves stability, avoids implausibly large effects, yet remains substantively uninformative.

**Rationale**

- Shifts of **4+ tokens** (40% of the scale) are already large in practice.  
- `Normal(0, 2)` limits 95% prior mass to about ±4, which remains wide enough while avoiding unrealistic extremes.  
- More appropriate for complex hierarchical models with many random slopes.

**Specification**

- **Fixed effects (slopes & interactions):**  
  - \( \beta_k \sim \text{Normal}(0, 2) \)

- **Intercept:**  
  - \( \text{Intercept} \sim \text{Normal}(5, 2) \)

- **Random effect SDs:**  
  - \( \sigma_{\text{RE}} \sim \text{Student-t}(3, 0, 1) \)  
    or a half-normal(0,1) prior

- **Residual SD:**  
  - \( \sigma \sim \text{Student-t}(3, 0, 2) \)

**Characteristics**

- Still weakly informative, but more realistic given the bounded 0–10 outcome scale.  
- Improves convergence and shrinkage in large multilevel structures.  
- Reduces the probability of implausible prior predictive draws (e.g., \(Y < -10\)).  


### Quantities of interest

In the following sections we define our substantive quantities of interest, affective polarization and its subcomponents, ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. Our substantive interest concerns the differences in these three measures between implicit and explicit partisan types. In the causal framing, we want to unravel the effect of a hypothetical intervention: If we hold all covariates constant and only change $T$ from $0$ to $1$, how does this impact our quantities of interest? 

#### Affective polarization

More precisely, we define affective polarization as the difference in expected token allocated in the conjoint games to co-partisans and out-partisans. This approach follows (?) Wagner (or Reiljan) in that it averages across all outgroups, which is a simplification given we are dealing with multi-party systems. Nevertheless, this (CHECK) yields a conservative measure, and allows for cross-national comparisons, as the number of parties in a given national party system varies, and so does the potential number of political outgroups.

Formally, we define affective polarization $AP$ as:

$$
AP = E(Y \mid R = Co) - E(Y \mid R = Out)
$$

These conditional expectations are further refined to capture the effect of explicit attachement:

$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{AP} &= AP_{T=1} - AP_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = Out,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = Out, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$

With the formulated hypothesis above, we posit that $CATE_{AP} > 0$: We expect respondents with explicit partisan type ($T=1$) to exhibit higher levels of affective polarization than implicit types ($T=0$).

#### Ingroup favoritms

Do disentangle affective polarization into ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation, we utilize that the conjoint setup included a neutral control group, in which no partisan cue was displayed ($R = None$). This allows as to estimate the effects of a copartisan cue ($R = Co$) relative to that neutral baseline, conditional on partisan type $T$.

Formally, we define ingroup favoritism $IF$ as:

$$
IF = E(Y \mid R = Co) - E(Y \mid R = None)
$$

further refining this equation with respect to partisan type $T$, we define our causal estimand as: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{IF} &= IF_{T=1} - IF_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = None,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = None, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$


#### Outgroup derogation

Similarly, the neutral control group ($R = None$) lets us estimate outgroup derogation as the average number in tokens withheld from outpartisans compared to the baseline condition.

Hence, we formalize outgroup derogation $OR$ as

$$
OR = E(Y \mid R = None) - E(Y \mid R = Out)
$$

the subsequent causal estimand is thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{OR} &= OR_{T=1} - OR_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = None, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = Out,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = None, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = Out, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$

By focusing on expected values, or marginal means, we also ensure our substantive results are not dependent on the choice of reference categories [@leeper2020measuring]. 

## Empirical analysis {#sec-analysis}

We present our findings in three stages. First, we present the distributions of explicit and implicit partisanship across our included country samples. Next, we present the overall average treatment effects of explicit partisanship on our outcomes of interest. Finally, we present cross-country variation of these pooled results to place our results in a comparative perspective.
