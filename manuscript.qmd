## 📝 Key Research Notes & Contributions

### 1. Conceptual & Theoretical Contribution
* **Identified Gap:** Existing studies on affective polarization either focus on **explicit partisan subsamples** or use whole samples (e.g., feeling thermometers), failing to analytically distinguish between types of attachment.
* **Analytical Distinction:** Introduces the distinction between:
    * **Explicit Partisans (Treatment, $T=1$):** Those who explicitly report partisan attachment.
    * **Implicit Partisans (Control, $T=0$):** Those who report **no** attachment but indicate a vote choice/intention.

---

### 2. Empirical Mapping & Research Question
* **Initial Analysis:** Examine the **distribution of explicit and implicit partisans** across 25 EU countries.
* **Figure 1:** Displays the cross-national distribution, establishing **substantial cross-national variation**.
* **Core Question:** **Does the explicit vs. implicit partisan distinction *matter* for behavior?** (I.e., what is its causal effect?)

---

### 3. Causal & Methodological Framework
* **Causal Objective:** Estimate the **conditional average causal treatment effect (CATE)** of being an Explicit Partisan ($T=1$).
* **Outcomes (QoIs):**
    * Affective Polarization ($Y_C - Y_O$)
    * In-group Favoritism ($Y_C - Y_{Non}$)
    * Out-group Derogation ($Y_{Non} - Y_O$)
* **Methodology:** Multilevel Regression Adjustment (Bayesian $brms$) using a **single, combined model** for all token allocations, including:
    * **Fixed Effects:** Treatment ($T$), Recipient Type ($R$: Co/Out/Non), and the crucial $\mathbf{T \times R}$ interaction (to directly estimate QoIs).
    * **Adjustment:** Control for key covariates ($X$) to satisfy the Conditional Independence Assumption (CIA).
    * **Structure:** Accounts for nesting via random effects (Rounds $\rightarrow$ Respondents $\rightarrow$ Parties $\rightarrow$ Countries), specifically including **random slopes for $T$ at the party level** ($\mathbf{1 + T \mid party\_id}$) for heterogeneity control.

### 4. Results & Findings Presentation
* **Figure 2 (Pooled AMCE):** Presents the **Average Marginal Component Effect (AMCE)** for all three QoIs across both game types (Dictator and Trust Game), summarizing the overall causal contribution of explicit attachment across 25 countries.
* **Heterogeneity Analysis:** Investigates substantial **country-level variation** in the causal effect.
* **Figures 3, 4, 5 (Country-Specific Effects):** Disaggregate the treatment effect for Affective Polarization, In-group Favoritism, and Out-group Derogation by country and game type. These figures utilize the estimated **random slopes and intercepts** from the multilevel model to show where the explicit/implicit distinction matters most.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

We attempt to estimate the average treatment effect of explicit partisanship on affective polarization and its subcomponents, ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation.
