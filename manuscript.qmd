## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

How does partisan type influence affective polariztion? 
While the past decade witnessed a sharp increase in publications dedicated to study the causes, consequences, and dynamics of affective polarization, there still remains much ambiguity when it comes to conceptualization and measurement.
Notably, some conceptual or measurement approaches limit their scope to only a partisan subset of the sample, while other strategies cover a wider range of the sampled electorate.
Nevertheless, the goal is often times identical: infer about the state or change of affective polarization in a given country's society.
If however such inferences are based on partisan subsets, inferring statements about that subset to the whole population rest on assumptions about the distribution of that subset in the population.
In other words, only if the partisan subset a) is large enough to constitute a (sufficiently) large part of the population or b) is representative of that population, one can validly infer from the subsample to the population.

This study aims to address this gap and contribute to the affective polarization literature in multiple ways.
First, I introduce the concept of *partisan type* to analytically distinguish between *explicit* and *implicit partisans*, enabling affective polarization scholars to better clarify what their sample of study and population of interest is.
Second, I empirically investigate the relative distributions of partisan types across 25 European multi-party system, finding cross-national variation in the relative shares but surprising consistencies regarding the overall numbers of partisans.
Third, I employ a causal identification strategy using hierarchical bayesian modelling to approach an answer to the question:
How would a hypothetical intervention changing a respondent's partisan type impact her affective polarization behavior, holding all other covariates constant?
Finally, I put things in a comparative perspective by studying cross-national variation in the hypothesized relationship between partisan type and affective polarization outcomes.

From a theoretical perspective, affective polarization emphasizes individuals' identities, their subjective feelings of belonging to a perceived group and the corresponding, emotional, *affective*, mechanisms that subconsciously influence human intergroup behaviors.
Hence, through this social identity perspective, we expect *explicit* partisan types to show stronger levels of affective polarization.
The rationale is that explicit reporting of feelt attachement corresponds to stronger group identites,

## Theory {#sec-theory}

### Lit Review

Aff Pol -> What is it and where it comes from (literature)

The concept of affective polarization, losely defined as the tendency to favor one's own party and disliking other parties, has received considerable attention following @iyengar2012affect's seminal paper. Since then, the social identity framework of political parties has been extended beyond the American case. According to classical social identity approaches,

Aff Pol -> what are causes, consequences, and dynamics (state of research)

Aff Pol Measurement/Conceptual ambiguities (problems)

Aff Pol ambiguities in Multiparty Systems/Comparative analyses specifically and recent trends (problems in comparative research)

### Argument

Concept of partisan type, distinguishing implicit and explicit partisan types, useful for addressing abiguities regarding subsamples and populations of interest.

Social identity theory: explicit types -> reported attachement (subjective belonging) -> indicates group identity -> higher ingroup outgroup mechanism

implicit ones: explicitly report no attachement -> no direct/conscious group attachement -> expressive group preference nevertheless through vote variables -> less polarization

-> HTs
Hypotheses:

$H_1$: Explicit partisans exhibit higher levels of affective polarization than implicit partisans.

$H_2$: Explicit partisans exhibit higher levels of ingroup favoritism than implicit partisans.

$H_3$: Explicit partisans exhibit higher levels of outgroup derogation than implicit partisans.

Note that these hypotheses are logically dependent: As ingroup favoritsm and outgroup derogation are two subcomponents that jointly make up affective polarization, if $H_1$ were true, either $H_2$ or $H_3$ or both have to be true by extension.

$H_2$: Explicit partisans exhibit both more ingroup favoritsm and more outgroup derogation than implicit partisans.

depending on literature, additional comparative hypothesis


## Research design {#sec-design}

This section outlines how we measure affective polarization and its subcomponents, the data we use, and out empirical strategy to estimate the effect of explicit partisanship on our outcomes of interest: affective polarization, ingroup favoritism, and outgroup derogation.

We conceptually frame explicit partisanship as a treatment and implicit partisanship as a control. That is, respondents reporting a subjective attachement to a political party ($T_i = 1$) form the treated group, whereas respondents expressing vote choice without attachement ($T_i = 0) form the comparison group.[^omit-quasi]

[^omit-quasi]: For readability, we omit the prefix "quasi-" when referring to treatment and control, but this does not imply random assignement. Our design remains observational.

The underlying research question is: Does explicit partisan attachement amplify affective polarization relative to implicit partisan attachement?

To approximate causal inference from observational variation, we exploit the following features of the data:

1. Tripartite structure of partisan and profile relationships. Each respondent $i$ is characterized by their *partisan type* ($T_i$) and a *partisan anchor* ($A_i$), which is either the party they feel attached to (explicit partisans, $T_i = 1$) or intend to vote for (implicit partisans, $T_i = 0$). Each conjoint profile presents a party cue ($Z^{party}_{ri}$), which is compared to the respondent's anchor to classify the profile as co-partisan, out-partisan, or neutral ($R_{ri} \in {Co, Out, None}$). This structure separates treatment assignment, i.e., partisan type ($T_i$), respondent identity, i.e., partisan anchor ($A_i$), and profile-level variation ($R_ri$).
2. Randomized conjoint profiles. The profiles' attributes -- including all non-partusab cues $Z^{other}_{ri}$ -- are randomly assigned. This ensures that observed differences in token allocations across $R_ri$ are attributable to profile characteristics rather than respondent selection.
3. Hierarchical variation. Respondents are nested within partisan anchors, which are themselves nested within countries. This allows for multilevel modeling that captures heterogeneity at the respondent, party, and country level.

In this section, we situate our measurement approach of affective polarization, present the used data and out empirical strategie to approximate an isolation of the causal effect of *explicit* partisanship on our outcomes of interest: affective polarization, ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation.

In causal terminology, explicit partisans form our treatment group ($T = 1$), with implicit partisans constituting our control group ($T = 0$).[^1]

The underlying idea is to study the effect of explicit subjective group attachement compared to implicit group attachement on affective polarization. 



The effect of the partisan-group-relative-variable is conditional on the type of partisanship. The partisan-group-relative-variable is itself a function of assigned partisan ingroup of respondents (by attachement for explicit and by vote intention/choice for implicit) and the displayed party affiliation of the conjoint profile.

Respondents vary along two analytically distinct dimensions. First, the partisan type ($T_i$) distinguishes respondents who report subjective partisan attachment (explicit partisans, $T_i=1$) from those who report a vote intention or choice in the absence of attachment (implicit partisans, $T_i = 0$). Second, each respondent is assigned a partisan anchor ($A_i$), defined as the party to which they report either attachment or vote intention. In the conjoint tasks, the party cue of profile $j$ is compared to anchor $A_i$ to generate a partisan relationship category ($R_{ij}∈\{Co,Out,Non\}$). This tripartite structure cleanly separates treatment status, party identity, and respondent–profile relationships, and it allows us to estimate the conditional effect of explicit partisan attachment across parties and countries using a hierarchical model with random effects for respondents, parties, and countries.

### Data {#sec-data}

We analyze data from @hahm2024divided ...

### Variables

Following our theoretical framework outlined before, we now operationalize our main variables.

Our main variable of interest is $T_i = \{1, 0\}$, which denotes the *partisan type* of respondent $i$. Values of $T_i = 1$ indicate explicit partisan type, i.e., respondents who reported a feeling of attachement to any political party. $T_i = 0$ marks implicit partisan types: respondents who actively reported not feeling attached to a political party, but expressed a party preference through a vote choice or intention variable.

Next, each respondent is assigned a *partisan anchor* ($A_i$), namely the party respondents indicated to feel attached to or has (intended to) voted for.

We use $Z_ri$ to denote the conjoint profile's cue presented in round $r$ to respondent $i$. These cues include dimension party, age, class, gender, religion, nationality and in case of the dictator game an EU attachement. $Z^{party}_{ri}$ marks the partisan cue, $Z^{other}_{ri}$ all other conjoint cues.

Given we are interested in the partisan effects, we limit observations to conjoint profiles with the nationality attribute fixed to that of the respective country (i.e., "co-national" from respondents' point of view), since there was never a partisan cue for outnationals to exclude implausible scenarios.

Figure X displays the causal data-generating structure. Respondents possess a partisan anchor $A$, defined as the party they feel close to (explicit partisans) or intend to vote for (implicit partisans). Partisan type $T$ (explicit vs. implicit) is only defined for respondents with a partisan anchor and is therefore a child node of $A$. The conjoint design randomizes all profile attributes. The partisan cue $Z^{party} combines with $A$ to produce the partisan relationship category $R=f(A,Z^{party})$, which determines whether the profile is interpreted as co-partisan, out-partisan, or neutral. Other randomized profile cues $Z^{other}$ affect the outcome directly. Token allocations $Y$ are affected by both $R$ and $Z^{other}$, with the effect of $R$ theorized to be conditional on $T$. Because $T$ is observational, we cannot assume conditional independence a priori, hence $C$ denotes potential confounders of both $T$ and $Y$.

To interpret the path $T \rightarrow R \rightarrow Y$ as the conditional causal effect of $T$, we must establish the following assumptions:

SUTVA -> Treatment outcomes are independent of treatment assignment to other units Y_i(1), Y_i(0)
Conditional Independence -> No confounders influencing T and Y
Covariate Balance -> $E[X \mid T = 1] = E[X \mid T = 0]$ Comparability of T=1 and T=0 
Common Support -> for every respondent, there is a positive probability of being assigned to both the treatment and control groups (fulfilled by subset to respondents with partisan anchor)

### Independent variables {#sec-iv}

We code...

Partisanship

$T = 1$ -> explicit partisanship
$T = 0$ -> implicit partisanship



### Dependent variable {#sec-dv}

Token allocated in the experiment

$Y$

### Control variables {#sec-dv}

### Causal model

Partisan Type -> Partisan Anchor -> Relationship Category -> Allocation

### Statistical model

The unit of observation is the specific profile evaluation (r) by respondent (i) who is nested within their assigned partisan anchor (a), which is itself nested within country (c). Thus, we have observations at Level 1, respondents at Level 2, partisan anchors at Level 3, and countries at Level 4.

Let $Y_{ri}$ be the number of tokens allocated in round $r$ by respondent $i$ of party $p$ in country $c$.

Then, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{riac} 
  &= \beta_0 
   + \beta_1 T_i 
   + \beta_2 R_{ri} 
   + \beta_3 \left(T_i \times R_{ri}\right)
   + \beta_4 Z^{\text{other}}_{ri}
   + \beta_5 C_i \\
  &\quad 
   + u_{i0}            
   + v_{a0} + v_{aT} T_i   
   + w_{c0} + w_{cT} T_i   
   + \varepsilon_{ri}
\end{aligned}
$$

with 

$$
\begin{aligned}
u_{i0} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_u^2), \\
\begin{pmatrix}
v_{a0} \\[4pt]
v_{aT}
\end{pmatrix}
&\sim \mathcal{N}\!\left(
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},
\Sigma_a
\right), \\
\begin{pmatrix}
w_{c0} \\[4pt]
w_{cT}
\end{pmatrix}
&\sim \mathcal{N}\!\left(
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},
\Sigma_c
\right), \\
\varepsilon_{ri} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Quantities of interest

In the following sections we define our substantive quantities of interest, affective polarization and its subcomponents, ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. Our substantive interest concerns the differences in these three measures between implicit and explicit partisan types. In the causal framing, we want to unravel the effect of a hypothetical intervention: If we hold all covariates constant and only change $T$ from $0$ to $1$, how does this impact our quantities of interest? 

#### Affective polarization

More precisely, we define affective polarization as the difference in expected token allocated in the conjoint games to co-partisans and out-partisans. This approach follows (?) Wagner (or Reiljan) in that it averages across all outgroups, which is a simplification given we are dealing with multi-party systems. Nevertheless, this (CHECK) yields a conservative measure, and allows for cross-national comparisons, as the number of parties in a given national party system varies, and so does the potential number of political outgroups.

Formally, we define affective polarization $AP$ as:

$$
AP = E(Y \mid R = Co) - E(Y \mid R = Out)
$$

These conditional expectations are further refined to capture the effect of explicit attachement:

$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{AP} &= AP_{T=1} - AP_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = Out,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = Out, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$

With the formulated hypothesis above, we posit that $CATE_{AP} > 0$: We expect respondents with explicit partisan type ($T=1$) to exhibit higher levels of affective polarization than implicit types ($T=0$).

#### Ingroup favoritms

Do disentangle affective polarization into ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation, we utilize that the conjoint setup included a neutral control group, in which no partisan cue was displayed ($R = None$). This allows as to estimate the effects of a copartisan cue ($R = Co$) relative to that neutral baseline, conditional on partisan type $T$.

Formally, we define ingroup favoritism $IF$ as:

$$
IF = E(Y \mid R = Co) - E(Y \mid R = None)
$$

further refining this equation with respect to partisan type $T$, we define our causal estimand as: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{IF} &= IF_{T=1} - IF_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = None,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = None, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$


#### Outgroup derogation

Similarly, the neutral control group ($R = None$) lets us estimate outgroup derogation as the average number in tokens withheld from outpartisans compared to the baseline condition.

Hence, we formalize outgroup derogation $OR$ as

$$
OR = E(Y \mid R = None) - E(Y \mid R = Out)
$$

the subsequent causal estimand is thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{OR} &= OR_{T=1} - OR_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = None, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = Out,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = None, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = Out, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$

## Empirical analysis {#sec-analysis}

We present our findings in three stages. First, we present the distributions of explicit and implicit partisanship across our included country samples. Next, we present the overall average treatment effects of explicit partisanship on our outcomes of interest. Finally, we present cross-country variation of these pooled results to place our results in a comparative perspective.
