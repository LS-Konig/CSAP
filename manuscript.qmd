  How does partisan type influence affective polarization?
subtitle: |
  A comparative study of 25 European democracies
abstract: |
  Affective polarization (AP) is increasingly viewed as multidimensional, yet many studies restrict inference to explicit partisans who report subjective attachement.
  In multiparty systems, many politically engaged citizens do not identify with any party, raising the question of whether explicit attachement is necessary for partisan bias.
  I introduce partisan type --- explicit versus implicit partisans (non-identifiers with clear vote anchors) --- and test whether it conditions AP.
  Using a conjoint experiment fielded in 25 European democracies (N~29,800), I combine randomized partisan cues with Bayesian models to estimate AP and its components in two behavioral games.
  Across both, explicit and implicit partisans display nearly identical ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation, with conditional effects centered near zero and consistent across countries.
  These findings imply that self-reported attachement adds little behavioral discriminatory content beyond partisan anchoring, supporting recent arguments that identity and substantive pathways yield similar partisan behaviros and clarifying AP measurement in multiparty contexts.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

1. Paragraph 1 -- Opening puzzle & stakes
  - Affective polarization (AP) has become a central concern because it transforms partisan differences into interpersonal hostility and civic threat, with potential implications for democratic norms and political violence. (Iyengar & Westwood 2015; Kalmoe & Mason 2022)
  - Yet scholars disagree about why AP arises: is it driven predominantly by social identity (explicit partisan attachment) or by substantive cues (policy/ideology) that people infer from party labels? (Orr et al. 2023; Dias & Lelkes 2022)

2. Paragraph 2 -- Measurement and conceptual fragmentation
  - AP is multidimensional --- evaluative, social, and behavioral indicators do not necessarily index the same process --- so measurement choice conditions theoretical claims (Campos & Federico 2025; Iyengar et al. 2012)
  - In particular, behavioral measures (allocations, trust) may reflect different mechanisms than evaluative thermometers, motivating focused tests in behavioral settings (Campos & Federico 2025; Cikara & Van Bavel 2014)

3. Paragraph 3 -- Comparative/multiparty complication
  - In multiparty systems the prevalence of explicit partisan attachment and the referent of "party" vary markedly across countries, making the population of inference unstable if studies restrict to explicit identifiers (Reiljan 2020; Wagner 2021)
  - This measurement heterogeneity complicates claims about the generality of identity-driven polarization derived from U.S.-centric research (Garzia et al. 2024; Campos & Federico 2025)

4. Paragraph 4 -- Prior work and undresolved debate (set the stage for our move)
  - Recent high-profile contributions disagree: Dias \& Lelkes (2022) argue partisan identity is principal, whereas Orr et al. (2023) show policy/substance explanations can generate the same patterns and that experimental manipulations often confound identity and perceived policy agreement (Dias & Lelkes 2022; Orr et al. 2023)
  - The Handbook and recent reviews highlight the same tension and call for designs that disentangle identity from cue-driven inferences, especially in comparative multiparty settings (Handbook: measurement chapters; Campos & Federico 2025)

5. Paragraph 5 -- What we do (concise contribution statement)
  - We introduce partisan type (explicit vs. implicit partisans) --- a multiparty generalization of the U.S. "leaners" logic --- and test whether explicit subjective attachement causally amplifies behavioral AP beyond the information contained in partisan anchors. (Keith et al. 1992; Klar & Krupnikov 2016; Campos & Federico 2025)
  - Using a cross-national conjoint reanalysis (25 European countries; dictator and trust games) and hierarchical Bayesian g-computation, we estimate within-profile causal effects of partisan cues and the observational contrast between partisan types while accounting for clustering and covariates. (Hahm et al. 2024; brms/Stan tradition — see methods)

6. Paragraph 6 -- Central empirical takeaway & high-level implication
  - Our pooled and country-level results show that explicit attachment adds little or no additional behavioral AP: implicit partisans (vote anchor without reported attachment) behave as discriminatingly as explicit identifiers across allocative and reciprocal tasks. (summary of findings)
  - This pattern implies that partisan categorization and cue-driven perceptions (ideology, norms) --- rather than subjective attachement per se --- suffices to generate much behavioral AP in Europe, challenging a straightforward identity-only interpretation (Orr et al. 2023; Campos & Federico 2025)

7. Paragraph 7 -- Roadmap
  - The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: theory and hypotheses; data and construction of partisan type; modeling and identification; pooled and country-specific results; robustness/sensitivity; discussion on measurement and theoretical implications

## Theory {#sec-theory}

#### The Rise of Affective Polarization {.unnumbered}

With *Affect, Not Ideology*, @iyengar2012affect shifted longstanding debates about polarization away from substantive policy disagreement [@poole1984polarization; @mccarty2006polarized; @fiorina2006culture; @fiorina2008polarization; @fiorina2008political; @abramowitz2006exploring; @abramowitz2008ispolarization; @abramowitz2010thedisappearing] toward a more social and emotional understanding of partisan conflict, emphasizing that partisans increasingly favor their own side while disliking or discriminating against the opposing party [@iyengar2015fear; @iyengar2019origins; @IyengarWagner2025Conceptualizing].
This reconceptualization catalyzed a vast research program investigating the drivers of affective polarization [@iyengar2019origins; @hobolt2024polarizing; @bail2018exposure; @dias2022nature; @orr2020policy; @rogowski2016ideology; @levendusky2013partisan; @mason2015disrespectfully; @mason2016acrosscutting; @mason2018ideologues; @tornberg2022digital; @luttig2017authoritarianism; @luttig2018prejudiced], its social, political, and economic consequences [@diermeier2019partisan; @berntzen2023consequencesofaffective; @mcconnell2018economic; @jenke2024affective; @kingzette2021affective; @huber2017political; @mcconnell2018economic; @broockman2023doesaffective; @lee2022social; @lee2025hate; @graham2020democracy], its temporal evolution [@iyengar2012affect; @iyengar2018strengthening; @iyengar2019origins], and possible interventions to reduce it [@adams2023can; @kalla2022voter; @levendusky2018americans; @druckman2023does; @mernyk2022correcting].
Initially focused on the American case, scholars have increasingly studied AP in Europe [@wagner2021affective; @reiljan2020fear; @hahm2024divided] and comparative contexts worldwide [@reiljan2024patterns; @torcal2023affective; @ferreira2024affective; @garzia2023affective; @boxell2024cross; @gidrom2020american].
Yet the rapid expansion of this literature, while demonstrating the broad reach of AP, has also generated conceptual and measurement ambiguities, as different operationalizations capture distinct facets of the phenomenon and yield divergent conclusions about its underlying nature [@campos2025new; @bakker2024putting; @CarlinLove2025Measuring; @IyengarWagner2025Conceptualizing]
This led scholars to refine theories of AP by clarifying who counts as partisan, distinguishing between horizontal hostility toward citizens and vertical hostility toward elites [@klar2018affective; @areal2024verticalvshorizontal; @druckman2019we], with the latter further differentiated into leader and party AP [@reiljan2024patterns], and addressing the added complexity of multiparty systems where ingroup and outgroup boundaries are less symmetric [@rollicke2023polarisation; @TorcalComellas2025Operationalizing].

#### Conceptual and Measurement Ambiguities {.unnumbered}

These debates intersect with normative concerns about which forms of AP pose tangible risks to democratic norms [@moore2020exaggerated; @mernyk2022correcting; @berntzen2023consequencesofaffective; @kingzette2021affective] and which fears may be overstated [@voelkel2023interventions; @westwood2022current; @westwood2022reply].
Most recently, @campos2025new proposed a multidimensional framework conceptualizing AP as comprising interrelated dimensions of othering, aversion, and moralization [see also @finkel2020political], accompanied by measurement strategies tailored to each subdimension.
This refinement is normatively consequential because different facets of AP vary substantially in their links to democratic erosion and political violence [@Berntzen2025PoliticalViolence; @berntzen2023consequencesofaffective; @kalmoe2022radical; @moore2020exaggerated].
Thus, although there is broad consensus that AP is empirically widespread, its fundamental sources and normative implications remain contested [@westwood2022current; @kalmoe2022aholistic; @broockman2023doesaffective], motivating the need for more precise distinctions in theory and measurement --- including the role of different forms of partisanship, which is the focus of this paper.

#### Identity-Based Mechanisms of Partisan Behavior {.unnumbered}

Social identity theory (SIT) provides the dominant framework for interpreting AP in political contexts.
Classic work shows that group identification generates predictable patterns of ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation—even when group boundaries are minimal or arbitrary [@tajfel1971social; @tajfel1974social; @tajfel1979integrative; @tajfel2004thesocial; @sherif1961intergroup; @allport1954thenature; @brewer1999psychology].
Applied to politics, these mechanisms imply that stronger partisan attachment should heighten discriminatory behavior toward partisan targets [@huddy2015expressive; @mason2013therise; @iyengar2015fear].
Contemporary accounts, such as the social-sorting perspective, further argue that when multiple social identities align with partisanship, partisan identity becomes more salient and conflictual, intensifying these behavioral tendencies [@greene1999understanding; @huddy2013group; @huddy2015expressive; @huddy2017political; @huddy2018expressive; @west2022partisanship; @mason2013therise; @mason2015disrespectfully; @mason2016acrosscutting; @mason2018ideologues; @mason2018one; @mason2018uncivil; @roccas2002social].

#### Substantive Inference and the Limits of Identity-Only Explanations {.unnumbered}

Despite the prominence of identity-based explanations for affective polarization, a growing body of work questions whether partisan identity alone drives discriminatory behavior, highlighting instead the role of ideological and substantive inferences [@bougher2017correlates; @webster2017ideological; @orr2020policy].
When individuals encounter a party label, they routinely update beliefs about policy positions, group norms, and social composition, making it difficult to isolate the behavioral effects of identity per se from those of inferred agreement [@dafoe2018information; @orr2023affective].
Whereas the “party-over-policy” view posits that partisan identity dominates ideology in generating AP [@dias2022nature; @iyengar2019origins], a contrasting “policy-over-party” perspective argues that perceived substantive (dis)alignment explains affective responses more than loyalty or identity strength [@bougher2017correlates; @webster2017ideological; @orr2020policy].
@orr2023affective show that experimental manipulations intended to vary partisan identity simultaneously shift perceived policy agreement, implying that identity-based and policy-based pathways often produce observationally equivalent behaviors.
This inferential entanglement extends even to behavioral experiments designed to cleanly measure ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation: partisan cues may function both as identity signals and as heuristics for ideology, and existing designs cannot fully disentangle the two mechanisms [@dafoe2018information].
Minimal-group and categorization research further complicates attribution by demonstrating that even arbitrary or shallow group boundaries can generate intergroup bias without subjective attachment [@sherif1961intergroup; @tajfel1974social], suggesting that simply anchoring individuals to a party or vote choice may be sufficient to trigger partisan discrimination.
Collectively, these insights crystallize a persistent “chicken-or-the-egg” problem: does partisan identity shape citizens’ policy perceptions and preferences [@dias2025american], or do shared preferences and ideological affinities generate the sense of partisan identity that AP research often treats as fundamental [@dias2022nature; @orr2023affective]?

#### Comparative Challenges in Multiparty Systems {.unnumbered}

A further challenge arises when shifting from the U.S. two-party context to the multiparty systems that characterize most European democracies, where the structure of partisan competition renders the study of affective polarization substantially more complex [@rollicke2023polarisation; @wagner2021affective].
Existing solutions vary widely: some approaches average evaluations across all out-parties, implicitly assuming a single ingroup [@reiljan2020fear; @hahm2024divided], others measure the overall dispersion of like–dislike scores within a party system @wagner2021affective, and still others incorporate the possibility of multiple ingroups or broader ideological blocs [@kekkonen2021affective; @kekkonen2022puzzles; @bantel2023camps; @reiljan2021ideological].
Yet these conceptual refinements underscore a deeper problem: measurement choices concerning who counts as a partisan --- and thus who is included in the analysis --- carry major implications for comparative inference [@garzia2023affective].
In Europe, rates of self-reported partisan attachment vary dramatically across countries and surveys, meaning that restricting analyses to explicit identifiers changes both the estimand and the population of interest, thereby undermining cross-national comparability.
Even the most widely used European AP measures --- @reiljan2020fear AP index and @wagner2021affective's spread measure --- differ precisely in how they operationalize the in-party, with the former focusing on reported identifiers and the latter encompassing the whole electorate.
Because most studies aim to draw conclusions about the population-level state or trajectory of AP, inference based solely on partisan subsamples is valid only if identifiers constitute a sufficiently large share of the electorate or accurately represent non-identifiers—conditions that rarely hold, given that the proportion of identifiers ranges from roughly 40% to 80% in our data.
These complications are heightened in contexts where the “poles of polarization” are less clearly structured than in the American two-party system [@rothers2025poles].
Unsurprisingly, scholars increasingly emphasize that conceptualization and measurement design strongly shape substantive conclusions about AP, strengthening the case for developing more generalizable frameworks --- such as partisan-type distinctions --- that travel across party systems [@campos2025new; @CarlinLove2025Measuring; @IyengarWagner2025Conceptualizing; @TorcalComellas2025Operationalizing]

#### A Generalizable Distinction: Explicit vs. Implicit Partisans {.unnumbered}

To address these conceptual and comparative limitations, we introduce a generalizable distinction between *explicit* and *implicit* partisans --- what we term *partisan type*.
Explicit partisans are individuals who report a felt attachment to a party, whereas implicit partisans are those who deny such attachment yet nevertheless express a partisan preference through loser-follow-up items or vote-choice questions.
This definition captures the theoretically crucial distinction between respondents who affirm subjective attachment and those who explicitly deny it while still revealing a partisan anchor.
Our approach synthesizes and extends classic insights from research on independents and leaners [@petrocik2009measuring; @elliott2024like; @kinder2017neither; @klar2016independent; @fowler2023moderates] as well as on implicit partisan identity [@hawkins2012motivated; @theodoridis2017me] to multiparty systems, thereby disentangling subjective identity from behavioral anchors in a way existing measures cannot.
Although conceptually closest to the U.S. notion of leaners, we adopt the more general term partisan type because leaner is tied to a distinctly American partisan structure in which self-identified independents occupy a meaningful middle category between two poles.
In multiparty Europe --- where voters confront multiple ideological camps rather than a single axis --- this metaphor does not travel cleanly, even though the underlying behavioral logic is similar.
The theoretical utility of partisan type lies in its ability to adjudicate between identity-based and substance-based mechanisms of affective polarization: if explicit partisans exhibit stronger discriminatory behavior than implicit partisans, this pattern would support identity-centered accounts, whereas similar behavior across types would indicate that partisan cues, ideological inferences, or categorization dynamics alone suffice to generate AP in the absence of reported attachment [@orr2023affective].
To the best of our knowledge, no existing work has systematically examined whether behavioral manifestations of AP differ between explicit and implicit partisans.
Conceptually, partisan type is narrower and more precise than “supporters” --- a category that encompasses both explicit and implicit types --- and avoids conflating subjective attachment with mere behavioral or expressive alignment.
By providing a simple but theoretically granular distinction that can be applied across party systems, partisan type clarifies scholars’ population of inference --- whether the focus is on identifiers (explicit partisans *only*) or on the broader electorate (explicit *and* implicit partisans) --- and thereby strengthens the analytical foundations for comparative research on affective polarization.

#### Hypotheses: Behavioral Expectations Across Partisan Types {.unnumbered}

The distinction between explicit and implicit partisans provides a direct empirical test of two competing explanations for affective polarization.
The identity-centered account holds that subjective partisan attachment is a unique psychological force: explicit identifiers should react more strongly to partisan cues because identity heightens ingroup affect, perceived threat, and willingness to derogate outgroups.
Under this view --- the party-over-policy hypothesis --- explicit partisanship should magnify all components of AP.
In contrast, the substance/categorization account posits that partisan labels convey ideological, social, and normative information that suffices to generate discriminatory behavior even without felt attachment.
This policy-over-party hypothesis predicts that implicit partisans, despite denying attachment, will discriminate to the same extent as explicit identifiers because categorization and inferred policy alignment --- not subjective identity --- drive affective and behavioral responses.
Our contribution is to adjudicate directly between these two explanations by comparing explicit and implicit partisans in identical behavioral settings across 25 multiparty systems.

Formally, these competing logics yield different hypotheses regarding the extent to which partisan types differ in their AP behaviors. 
If explicit attachement exerts an independent identity effect, then the party-over-policy hypothesis would predict:

- **H1a**: Explicit partisans exhibit *greater* affective polarization than implicit partisans.
- **H2a**: Explicit partisans show *greater* ingroup favoritism than implicit partisans.
- **H3a**: Explicit partisans express *greater* outgroup derogation than implicit partisans. 

Conversely, if the policy-over-party mechanism holds and partisan cues and inferred ideological (dis)agreement would be sufficient to generate AP absent reported attachement, the following empirical implications should hold:

- **H1b**: Explicit and implicit partisans *do not* differ in affective polarization.
- **H2b**: Explicit and implicit partisans *do not* differ in ingroup favoritism.
- **H3b**: Explicit and implicit partisans *do not* differ in outgroup derogation.

#### Empirical Leverage and Theoretical Contribution {.unnumbered}

Together, these hypotheses allow us to distinguish whether behavioral AP in multiparty systems reflects the unique psychological force of explicit partisan identity (H1a–H3a) or whether partisan anchoring and cue-driven inferences alone are sufficient to reproduce AP’s behavioral signature (H1b–H3b).
Our empirical strategy is designed to leverage these competing mechanisms while remaining clear about the boundaries of what can be identified.
By using a conjoint experiment with within-respondent randomization of partisan cues, we secure causal identification of how individuals respond to profiles labeled with ingroup or outgroup party information, independent of respondent characteristics.
We then pair this with hierarchical Bayesian models and g-computation to estimate the observational contrast between explicit and implicit partisans while adjusting for covariates and country-level clustering—precisely the combination required to adjudicate whether subjective attachment magnifies behavioral AP or whether partisan anchors alone suffice.
Although our design cannot fully decompose the identity and substantive components embedded in the party cues themselves, it allows us to test a question that prior work has not: whether explicitly reported partisan attachment—often used as a proxy for identity—adds distinct behavioral content beyond what is already induced by partisan categorization and policy inference.
In doing so, we contribute to the literature in three main ways.
First, we introduce partisan type as a conceptual refinement that clarifies the population of inference in empirical AP research, extending the logic of U.S. “leaners” and implicit partisan identity to multiparty systems. Second, we document substantial cross-national variation in the prevalence of explicit and implicit types, underscoring the measurement heterogeneity that complicates comparative claims about identity-driven polarization. 
Third, we isolate the behavioral consequences of explicit attachment across two games and 25 countries, allowing us to evaluate directly whether explicit partisanship amplifies affective polarization.
If explicit types exhibit stronger ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation, this would bolster identity-centered, party-over-policy accounts; if they behave similarly to implicit types, this would imply that reporting a felt attachment adds little beyond the informational and categorization processes captured by policy-over-party perspectives.
In either case, our results speak directly to ongoing debates about the mechanisms underlying AP and refine both @orr2023affective's critique and the multidimensional framework of @campos2025new by identifying which behavioral components of AP are --- and are not --- meaningfully shaped by subjective partisan identity.



## Research Design {#sec-design}

In this section, we detail our empirical strategy for identifying the effect of partisan type on affective polarization.
We begin by introducing the dataset and experimental design, then describe the construction of partisan types and anchors, including a cross-national overview of their distribution.
This distributional evidence clarifies the scope of the analytical sample and motivates our comparative research design.
We then outline the key variables of interest and present a directed acyclical graph (DAG) that summarizes our causal model of the data-generating process.
Next, we specify the statistical model and explain how we obtain the quantities of interest, followed by a justification of our covariate set.
Finally, we enumerate the assumptions required for causal interpretation and situate our design within the broader literature, highlighting both strengths and remaining limitations.

### Data and Experimental Design {#sec-data}

To evaluate how different partisan types influence AP, we reanalyze the cross-national conjoint experiment conducted by @hahm2024divided.
The study was fielded by Dynata (formerly SSI) in 25 EU member states between late May and mid-August 2019.[^1]
National samples consist of approximately 1,100 respondents per country (29,827 in total), drawn to be broadly representative on key sociodemographic dimensions. 
Summary statistics appear in table XX in the appendix.

[^1]: The countries covered are all EU member states (which included the UK at the time of data collection) except Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus.

The experiment comprised two behavioral games: a dictator game capturing unilateral prosociality and a trust game introducing reciprocal incentives.
As the games capture conceptually distinct behavioral settings, they will be analyzed separately.
In each round, respondents interacted with a hypothetical partner with attributes ranging from age, gender, class, religion, to nationality and partisanship.[^2]
All conjoint attributes, including the partisan cue, were randomized independently with one restriction: partisan labels were displayed only when the profile’s nationality matched the respondent’s own country.
This restriction was implemented to avoid implausible cross-national partisan combinations and maintain realism of the profile space.
As a consequence, our analysis is restricted to the subset of profiles in which the partner is a conational.
Within this restricted set, the control condition corresponds to conational profiles without a displayed partisan label.
These restrictions do not affect randomization of the remaining attributes and preserve the “as-if random” variation in partisan cues among conational partners.
Each respondent completed three rounds of each game, yielding six observations per participant.
Our unit of analysis is thus a single game round.
The resulting data are inherently nested: multiple rounds within respondents, respondents nested within party affiliations, and respondents and parties clustered within countries.
We therefore rely on hierarchical models, described in detail in @sec-model.

[^2]: Detailed information, instruction wording and an exemplary profile are presented in the appendix.

These behavioral measures offer several advantages for studying affective polarization.
First, the design is explicitly suited to assessing *horizontal* AP among mass partisans [@areal2024verticalvshorizontal].
Common observational indicators --- such as like/dislike scales or feeling thermometers --- conflate horizontal evaluations of fellow citizens with *vertical* evaluations of party elites, thereby limiting their interpretability [@druckman2019we].
Second, the inclusion of a nonpartisan baseline condition enables us to causally decompose AP into its constituent components: ingroup favoritism (IF) toward co-partisans and outgroup derogation (OD) toward rival partisans.
We estimate these components using standard conjoint estimands that capture the average marginal effect of each attribute on token allocations [@hainmueller2014causal].

Third, respondents hold multiple, potentially cross-cutting social identities [@roccas2002social].
The randomized conjoint design mitigates bias arising from such heterogeneity by independently varying several attributes that might otherwise be confounded with partisan cues.
This feature allows us to isolate the specific effect of partisanship and reduces the risks of "aliasing" [@hainmueller2014causal] and "masking" [@bansak2021conjoint], which occur when omitted attributes correlate with treatment dimensions [@dafoe2018information].[^3]
Finally, by embedding partisan information among multiple randomized cues, conjoint tasks are less susceptible to social desirability pressures than direct survey questions [@horiuchi2022does].

[^3]: Naturally, a conjoint design can only include a limited set of attributes and therefore cannot preclude all forms of aliasing; we make no claim to exhaustiveness.
Nonetheless, by randomizing several plausibly correlated characteristics (e.g., age, gender), the design reduces the risk that inferences about partisanship merely reflect respondents' assumptions about the social composition of party supporters.
In this respect, it is substantially less susceptible to the confounding that affects like/dislike scales or feeling thermometers, which cannot disentangle the effect of partisanship from correlated beliefs about associated social groups.

### Measurement and Variable Construction {#sec-vars}

We construct our main variables of interest following a tripartite framework to ensure conceptual coherence and terminological consistency in all party-related measures.
First, we define $T_i$ as the *partisan type* of respondent $i$.
If respondent $i$ reported a party to which she feels attached to and is thus considered an *explicit* partisan, we define $T_i = 1$. Conversely, we set $T_i = 0$ for *implicit* partisans, i.e., respondent $i$ who indicated no partisan attachement but reported a vote preference.
We term the party reported by respondents *partisan anchor* $A_i$.[^4]

[^4]: We use the term *partisan anchor* to denote the party reference point reported by respondents, regardless of whether they express subjective attachment to that party. For explicit partisans, this anchor corresponds to the conventional *partisan ingroup* in the literature (as in @hahm2024divided). For implicit partisans, however, respondents explicitly deny a felt attachment, making social-identity terminology inappropriate. The term *anchor* therefore provides a neutral label that applies consistently across both groups.

To evaluate the scope conditions of our design and to clarify the population of inference, we begin by documenting the distribution of partisan types in each of the 25 country samples.
@fig-impl-expl-distribution presents the share of respondents classified as explicit partisans, implicit partisans, and nonpartisans (type undefined).
Two features of these descriptive patterns are substantively important.
First, the proportion of nonpartisans is remarkably stable across countries (ranging mostly between 10 and 15\%, least in Estonia (6\%), most in Croatia (23\%)), suggesting that the exclusion of this group --- required for treatment consistency in our design --- does not introduce systematic cross-national biases in the analytical sample.
Second, and more consequential for our theoretical claims, the balance between explicit and implicit partisans varies dramatically across national contexts.
In some electorates, explicit identifiers constitute the clear majority of partisans (e.g. strongest case being Denmark with 85\% explicit partisans), in others, implicit partisans are equally prevalent (e.g. in Latvia both explicit and implicit partisans account for 45\% of respondents).
This heterogeneity underscores the need for a comparative framework capable of assessing whether implicit and explicit partisans differ systematically in their affective responses.
In short, the figure motivates both the internal validity of our sample restriction and the broader comparative question that animates the study: whether distinct partisan types, whose prevalence differs markedly across countries, exhibit different patterns of affective polarization.

{{< embed code/preparation/01_wrangling.qmd#fig-impl-expl-distribution >}}

In the experiment, each conjoint profile in round $r$ contains a randomized party cue ($Z^{party}_{r}$).
We compare this cue to the respondent's anchor to classify the *partisan relationship* $R_{ri}$ as co-partisan, out-partisan, or neutral ($R_{ri} \in \{Co, Out, None\}$).
This coding corresponds to the average across out-groups operationalization [@reiljan2020fear] and offers a tractable strategy for multi-party contexts, although it constitutes a substantial reduction of the inherent complexity of AP in multi-party systems [@rollicke2023polarisation].
We adopt this measure as it provides a uniform and comparable classification scheme across countries.

We conceptually frame explicit partisanship as the treatment and implicit partisanship as a control.
Respondents reporting a subjective attachement to a political party ($T_i = 1$) thus form the treated group, whereas respondents expressing vote choice without attachement ($T_i = 0$) constitute the comparison group.[^5]
The underlying research question is: Does explicit partisan attachement amplify affective polarization relative to implicit partisan attachement?
In causal terms, we ask how a hypothetical intervention shifting $T$ from 0 to 1 would change affective polarization, holding other factors constant.

[^5]: For readability, we omit the prefix "quasi-" when referring to treatment and control, without implying random assignement. Our design remains observational with respect to our treatment of interest, partisan type $T$.

@fig-dag depicts the underlying causal data-generating process as a directed acyclical graph (DAG).
As noted above, respondents report a partisan anchor $A$.
Partisan type $T$ is defined only for the subset of respondents who either explicitly or implicitly report a party and therefore appears as a child node of $A$.
In each round $r$ of the conjoint games, respondents receive a set of conjoint attributes, denoted by $Z_r$.
The partisan cue $Z_r^{\text{party}}$ and respondents' anchors $A_i$ jointly determine the partisan relationship category via the mapping $f:(A_i, Z_r^{\text{party}} \mapsto R_{ij} \in \{\text{Co}, \text{Out}, \text{None}\})$.

The dependent variable $Y_{riac}$ is the token allocation made in round $r$ by respondent $i$ with anchor $a$ from country $c$.
Token allocations $Y$ are affected by both $R$ and $Z_r^{\text{other}}$, with the effect of $R$ theorized to be conditional on $T$.
Because $T$ is observational, we cannot assume conditional independence.
We therefore include $C$ to capture individual-level confounders affecting both $T$ and $Y$.
Graphically, our substantive interest lies in the causal chain $T \to R \to Y$, namely the effect of $R$ on $Y$ conditional on $T$, represented as the central vertical path in @fig-dag.

{{< embed code/preparation/02_descr_anal.qmd#fig-dag >}}

### Model Specification and Estimation {#sec-model}

We model the data in their natural hierarchical structure.
The unit of analysis is a single conjoint profile evaluation in round $r$ of a game.
Profile evaluations ($r$) are nested within respondents ($i$), respondents are grouped by their partisan anchors ($a$), i.e., the party to which they report attachement or vote intention, and anchors are nested within countries ($c$).
This yields a four-level structure: Level 1 (round $r$) $\to$ Level 2 (respondent $i$) $\to$ Level 3 (anchor a) $\to$ Level 4 (country c).

Let $Y_{riac}$ denote the number of tokens allocated (0-10) in round $r$ by respondent $i$ with partisan anchor $a$ in country $c$.
Respondent partisan type is $T_i \in \{0,1\}$ (implicit vs explicit).
The respondent-profile partisan relationship $R_{ri} \in \{\text{Co, Out, None}\}$ is a deterministic function of the respondent's anchor and the profiles partisan cue.
$Z_{r}^{\text{other}}$ denotes the matrix of all other conjoint attributes, and $C_i$ constitutes a matrix of respondent-level covariates discussed in @sec-covariates.

To estimate how explicit partisan type conditions responsiveness to partisan cues, we specify a multilevel model with a cross-level interaction between $T_i$ and $R_{ri}$ and random effects at the respondent, anchor, and country levels, as shown in @eq-model-sys:

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{riac}
&= \beta_0
  + \beta_1 T_i

\noindent We assume a Gaussian likelihood for the bounded (0-10, see @fig-distr-y in the appendix) token allocation.
While the discrete nature and strict bounds of the outcome violate the technical assumptions of the Gaussian family (as the distribution is constrained and not continuous), the approach is justified by its focus on the marginal means effects ($AP$, $IF$, $OD$).
The estimator for the regression coefficients derived from this likelihood family is mathematically equivalent to the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator under fixed effects and Normal errors [@wooldridge2010econometric].
Crucially, the OLS estimator provides unbiased and consistent estimates of the conditional mean $E(Y \mid X)$ under large samples, even when the residuals are non-Normal or heteroskedastic, relying on asymptotic properties [@white1980heteroskedasticity].
This pragmatic choice allows for directly interpretable coefficients on the original token allocation scale, avoiding the complexity of nonlinear link functions.
Furthermore, the inclusion of a rich covariate set and the respondent-level random intercept ($u_{i0}$) helps to absorb substantial structured variance, mitigating the severity of residual non-Normality that often arises from bounding effects.
Respondent-level random intercepts are assumed to follow a normal distribution (@eq-resp-int):

$$
u_{i0} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{u0})
$$ {#eq-resp-int}

\noindent To capture heterogeneous treatment and cue effects, we include a random intercept and random slopes for $T$ and $R$ at the partisan anchor level.
These random effects are assumed to be jointly normal (@eq-re-anchor), with intercepts and slopes allowed to be correlated:

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
v_{a0} \\ v_{aT} \\ v_{aR}
\end{pmatrix}
\sim
\mathcal{N}\!\left(
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix},
\Sigma_a
\right),
$$ {#eq-re-anchor} 
\doublespacing

\noindent Similarly, we include random intercepts and random slopes for $T$ and $R$ at the country level, also assumed to be jointly normal (@eq-re-country):

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
w_{c0} \\ w_{cT} \\ w_{cR}
\end{pmatrix}
\sim
\mathcal{N}\!\left(
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix},
\Sigma_c
\right),
$$ {#eq-re-country} 
\doublespacing

\noindent Both $\Sigma_a$ and $\Sigma_c$ are unstructured $3 \times 3$ covariance matrices, allowing intercepts and slopes to be estimated as correlated at the anchor and country levels.
Residuals are assumed to be normally distributed around $0$ (@eq-error): 
$$
\varepsilon_{riac} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2).
$$ {#eq-error}

The interaction $\beta_3(T_i \times R_{ri})$ is the key parameter: it captures how explicit partisan type ($T_i = 1$) conditions sensitivity to co-, out- and nonpartisan cues ($R_{ri}$).
Because all profile attributes -- including the partisan cue -- are randomized within respondents, $R_{ri}$ varies as-if at random conditional on $A_i$, supporting causal interpretation of cue effects within each partisan type.
We allow the effect of $R_{ri}$ to vary across partisan anchors ($v_{aR}$) and across countries ($w_{cR}$) to capture heterogeneity plausibly structured by party and national context.
Put differently, the magnitude of affective polarization and its subcomponent likely varies across parties and across countries, and the random slopes are designed to account for this structure.
Similarly, the effect of $T_i$ is allowed to vary across partisan anchors ($v_{aT}$) and countries ($w_{cT}$), reflecting that the meaning and salience of explicit attachement differ across parties and settings.
Respondent-level heterogeneity in baseline generosity is captured by the random intercept $u_{i0}$.
We do not include respondent-level random slopes for $R_{ri}$ as recommended by @heisig2019you, because within-respondent variation in partisan-relationship categories is insufficient to reliably estimate individual-specific cue sensitivities.
Excluding this slope shifts heterogeneity in cue sensitivity to the anchor and country levels, remaining individual-level variation is absorbed by higher-level and residual variances.
The correlated random-effects structure enables partial pooling, stabilizing heterogeneous treatment and cue-effect estimates while preserving systematic contextual variation.

We estimate the model in a Bayesian framework via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation implemented in Stan [@rstan] using the `brms` package in R [@burkner2017brms; @burkner2017advanced; @burkner2021bayesian].
This approach propagates uncertainty through the multilevel interaction structure and regularizes the maximal random-effects specification through priors.
Our priors are weakly informative and tailored to the 0-10 outcome scale.
Fixed-effect parameters ($\beta_k$) receive $\mathcal{N}(0, 2)$ priors, which center effects at zero while constraining 95\% of prior mass to approximately $\pm 4$ tokens --- a substantively large shift (40\% of the scale) given the initial findings of @hahm2024divided.
The model intercept receives a $\mathcal{N}(5, 2)$ prior centered at the midpoint of the token scale.
Standard deviations of the random effects $\sigma_{RE}$ are assigned $\text{Half-student-}t(3, 0, 1)$ priors.
This distribution is defined exclusively on the positive domain ($[0, \infty)$) and has heavier tails compared to the Half-Normal distribution, allowing for the possibility of larger group-level variability while still shrinking effects towards zero.
The residual standard deviation $\sigma$ is assigned a $\text{Half-student-}t(3, 0, 2)$ prior.
These priors improve convergence, facilitate shrinkage in a high-dimensional multilevel structure, and reduce the probability of implausible prior-predictive draws (e.g., $Y > 10$).

The randomized conjoint design secures internal validity for profile-level effects ($R_{ri}$ and other $Z$ attributes) within partisan types.
The contrast across partisan types (i.e, the effect of $R$ conditional on $T$) remains observational and is identified under adjustmend for $C_i$ and the multilevel structure.
Our hierarchical specification -- allowing anchor- and country-varying slopes -- and weakly informative priors stabilize these comparisons while transparently reflecting remaining uncertainty in the posterior.

### Quantities of Interest: AP, IF and OD {#sec-qoi}

In this section we define our three substantive quantities of interest --- AP and its two constituent components, IF and OD.
Our empirical focus lies in comparing these measures across implicit and explicit partisan types.
Framed causally, we aim to recover the effect of a hypothetical intervention: holding all covariates constant, how do these quantities of interest change when $T$ is set from $0$ (implicit type) to $1$ (explicit type)?

We conceptualize affective polarization as the difference in the expected number of tokens allocated to co-partisans versus out-partisans in the conjoint games.
This follows the approach used in prior work (CHECK Wagner Reiljan), which averages across all political outgroups --- a simplification in multi-party systems but one that yields a conservative measure and facilitates cross-national comparison, as both the number of viable parties and the size of the outgroup set vary across countries.
Formally, we define affective polarization $AP$ as:

$$
AP = E(Y \mid R = Co) - E(Y \mid R = Out)
$$ {#eq-ap}

\noindent With respect to partisan type, we define our causal estimand as the conditional average treatment effect:

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{AP} &= AP_{T=1} - AP_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = Out,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = Out, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-cateap}
\doublespacing

To disentangle AP into its components, we exploit the neutral control condition in the conjoint experiment, in which no partisan cue was displayed ($R = \text{None}$).
This allows us to estimate the extent to which co-partisanship increases token allocations relative to a neutral baseline, conditional on $T$.
We define ingroup favoritism $IF$ as:

$$
IF = E(Y \mid R = Co) - E(Y \mid R = None)
$$ {#eq-if}

\noindent Refining this with respect to partisan type yields the causal estimand:

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{IF} &= IF_{T=1} - IF_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = None,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = None, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-cateif} 
\doublespacing

The same neutral condition ($R = \text{None}$) also enables estimation of outgroup derogation as the reduction in tokens allocated to out-partisans compared to the baseline.
Outgroup derogation $OD$ is defined as:

$$
OD = E(Y \mid R = None) - E(Y \mid R = Out)
$$ {#eq-od}

\noindent The corresponding causal estimand is:

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{OD} &= OD_{T=1} - OD_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = None, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = Out,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = None, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = Out, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-cateod} 
\doublespacing

By focusing on expected values (marginal means), we ensure that our substantive results do not depend on arbitrary choices of reference categories [@leeper2020measuring].
Consistent with our hypotheses stated in @sec-ht, we expect all $CATE_{AP, IF, OD} > 0$: respondents with explicit partisan attachements ($T=1$) should display higher affective polarization than implicit types ($T=0$), caused simoultaneously by higher degrees of IF as well as stronger OD.

### Covariates and Confounder Adjustment {#sec-covariates}

To block potential backdoor paths between partisan type and allocation behavior ($C_i$ in @fig-dag), we adjust for a comprehensive set of individual-level covariates capturing the principal dimensions that may jointly predict explicit partisan attachement and prosocial behavior in experimental settings.

First, we include standard sociodemographic characteristics: age, gender, education, social class, religious affiliation, and urban-rural residence.
Second, we control for respondents' political orientations and ideological predispositions, including left-right self-placement, cultural and economic nativism, attitudes toward the EU, and satisfaction with democracy.
Third, we account for political interest, engagement, and knowledge.
Fourth, we incorporate attitudes toward parties, elites, and democratic processes, capturing broader orientations toward the political system that plausibly shape both group attachement and intergroup conduct.
Finally, we include economic evaluations and behavioral despositions (risk-taking and temporal discounting) to adjust for contextual and psychological factors associated with baseline generosity.

Together, these covariates represent substantively plausible confounders and help approximate conditional independence between partisan type and the outcome of interest.
Summary statistics for all covariates by partisan type appear in @tbl-covariate-distr, and English-language questionnaire items are provided in the appendix.

### Identification Strategy and Causal Assumptions

Our empirical strategy aims to estimate the causal effect of explicit partisan type ($T=1$) relative to implicit partisan type ($T=0$) on affective polarization (AP, IF, OD).
The identification approach combines strong internal validity provided by the conjoint experiment for the profile attributes ($Z$) with an extensive model-based adjustmend strategy for the observed contrast across partisan types ($T$).

The conjoint design provides strong leverage: all profile attributes ($Z$) are randomized within each round.
Since the respondent-profile relationship ($R_{ri}$) is a deterministic function of a randomized cue ($Z_r^{\text{party}}$) and the respondent's partisan anchor ($A_i$), the profile-level variation that drives AP, IF, and OF is as-if random.
Consequently, the effect of $R$ (and other randomized attributes) on the token allocation $Y_{riac}$ is causally identified by design, conditional on the respondent's partisan type $T$.

The key identification challenge is the conditioning of cue effects on partisan type, estimated via the interaction $T \times R$.
Identification of this contrast relies on the observational assumption that $T$ is conditionally independent of potential outcomes, given the comprehensive set of covariates $C$ and the full hierarchical structure.
Our modeling strategy is explicitly designed to manage this residual confounding.

We formally state the key assumptions and detail our strategy for addressing the principal threat of unobserved confounding:

#### SUVTA {.unnumbered}

We assume no interference across respondents and a well-defined treatment.
The survey was administered individually and anonymously, rendering cross-respondent spillovers unlikely.
Dependence across rounds within respondents is mitigated by randomized profiles and explicitly modeled via the respondent-level random intercepts.
Treatment consistency is ensured through a precise coding of $T$, exclusion of nonpartisan respondents from the analysis, and by allowing its effect to vary across parties and countries.

#### Conditional Independence (Ignorability) of $T$ {.unnumbered}

Conditional on the set of observed covariates $C$ and the grouping units (partisan anchor, country), assignment to explicit versus implicit partisan type is assumed intependent of potential outcomes.
While randomization of $Z$ secures identification of the effects of $R$, the causal interpretation of the Conditional Average Treatment Effects ($CATE$s) across $T$ rests on this ignorability assumption.

#### Covariate Balance {.unnumbered}

Observed covariates should be comparably distributed across $T=1$ and $T=0$.
Descriptive assessments in @tbl-covariate-distr in the appendix indicate a high degree of distributional symmetry across the two groups.
The medians are identical for 21 out of 23 scaled political and economic variables, suggesting that the regression adjustment (via $\beta_5C_i$) starts from a strong, balanced position, substantially mitigating confounding by observed characteristics.
Categorical sociodemographic variables also show similar proportions, with the main observed difference being that explicit partisans ($T=1$) are more likely to be male (53% vs 43%).

#### Common Support (Overlap) {.unnumbered}

Both partisan types must occur with positive probability for observed covariate profiles across all grouping units.

The principal threat to the causal interpretation of the $CATE$s is residual confounding: unmeasured factors may jointly influence selection into $T$ and allocation behavior $Y$.
We deploy a multilevel strategy that leverages the repeated-measures design to control for unobserved condounding at all three hierarchical levels:

1.  Respondent-level adjustment ($u_{i0}$):
The inclusion of a respondent-level random intercept acts as a powerfull control for all stable, time-invariant, unobserved individual characteristics (e.g., latent personality traits, baseline generosity, or stable intensity of social identity) that may affect both selection into $T$ and the outcome $Y$.
This leverage is fundamental to our observational identification strategy.

2.  Partisan anchor-level adjustment ($v_{a0}, v_{aT}, v_{aR}$): The random effects at the partisan anchor level account for unobserved confounding systematic across party lines.
They absorb average unobserved differences (e.g., party organizational culture or ideological uniformity) that influence both the propensity for explicit attachement ($T$) and baseline prosocioality ($Y$).
The random slopes for $T$ and $R$ further allow the confounding or effect size to vary by party.

3.  Country-level adjustment ($w_{c0}, w_{cT}, w_{cR}$):
The country-level random effects address unobserved confounding operating at the national context level.
This accounts for country-specific factors (e.g., general political climate, institutional trust, or overall polarization intensity) that influences both the prevalence of explicit attachement ($T$) and the general levels of prosocial behavior ($Y$).

Our hierachical Bayesian model encodes this strategy.
All reported estimands are obtained via g-computaion (observed-values approach), averaging posterior expectations over the empirical covariate distribution and relevant grouping units, which propagates uncertainty through the entire multilevel structure.

We are confident in the internal validity of profile-level effects ($R$ and other $Z$ attributes) and of the derived quantities ($AP$, $IF$, $OD$) conditional on $T$, as these rely on random assignement of $Z$.
The contrast between explicit and implicit partisans --- the $CATE$s --- is necessarily more assumption-intensive.
Our modeling strategy, combining rich covariate adjustment and hierarchical partial pooling, substanially reduces, though cannot eliminate, the possibility of unobserved confounding.

Our goal is to approximate the effect of a hypothetical intervention shifting a respondent's partisan type from implicit ($T=0$) to explicit ($T=1$), holding other factors constant.
Because $T$ is observational, this interpretation is valid only under the assumptions outlined above.
We thus present the resulting estimates as the best model-based causal approximation afforded by the available data and the experimental design.

## Empirical analysis

We organize the presentation of results in two steps.
We begin with pooled analyses based on posterior expected values generated from the fitted hierarchical model.
These expected values are computed for prespecified combinations of respondent's partisan type (T=0 implicit, T=1 explicit) and partisan relationship category (R = Co, Out, None) in a given game round, averaging over the empirical distribution of covariates and integrating over respondent random effects.
From these expected values, we derive the three substantive quantities of interest --- affective polarization (AP), ingroup favoritism (IF), and outgroup derogation (OD) --- for each value of T.
The difference between the quantities under explicit and implicit partisanship yields the CATE for each QoI.

The pooled results sections display, for each QoI, the posterior distributions for explicit and implicit partisans (left panels) alongside the posterior distributions of the corresponding CATE (right panels).
All panels visualise full posterior densities along with respective medians, 95\% and 99\% credible intervals.

We then turn to country-specific analyses, where we recompute expected values separately within each national subsample (again averaging over that country's empirical covariate distribution, but this time incorporating random effects).
Because the resulting CATEs show little cross-national variation, we additionally report the underlying country-level expected values for each relationship category.
These reveal substantial heterogeneity in the levels of AP, even as the implicit-explicit comparison remains consistently close to zero across countries.

All results are presented separately for the dictator and trust games.
For scale reference, a one-token difference corresponds to 42.6\% of a standard deviation in the dictator game and 40.2\% in the trust game.

### The effect of partisan type on affective polarization in Europe

#### Dictator game {.unnumbered}

@fig-pooled-cov-d displays the pooled dictator-game estimates.
Interpreted within the causal framework introduced above --- where the CATE approximates the effect of a hypothetical intervention shifting individuals from *implicit* ($T=0$) to *explicit* ($T=1$) partisan type --- the findings suggest that such an intervention would have, at most, minimal consequences for allocative discrimination.

{{< embed code/postproduction/06_figures.qmd#fig-pooled-cov-d >}}

The overall AP contrast is highly similar across partisan types.
Explicit identifiers allocate on average 0.99 tokens more to co-partisans than to out-partisans (median AP = 0.99; 95\% CrI: 0.91, 1.08), virtually matching the behavior of implicit partisans (0.93; 95\% CrI: 0.75, 1.10).
The estimated causal effect is therefore small (CATE = 0.07; 95\% CrI: -0.11, 0.24), with roughly three-quarters of its posterior mass concentrated below 0.1 tokens.
Although the direction of the posterior mode is consistent with H1a (stronger AP among explicit identifiers), the uncertainty dominates, and the key empirical signal is the strength of AP among implicit partisans.
Even without self-reported attachment, they display clear and precisely estimated discriminatory allocations --- consistent with H1b, the hypothesis that categorization alone suffices to generate behavioral AP.

A similar pattern appears for ingroup favoritism.
Explicit partisans show a strong tendency to reward co-partisans relative to neutral alters (median IF = 0.54; 95\% CrI: 0.46, 0.63), and implicit partisans exhibit a nearly equivalent tendency (median = 0.45; 95\% CrI: 0.26, 0.64).
The corresponding causal contrast again remains modest (CATE = 0.09; 95\% CrI: -0.10, 0.25).
The posterior probability that explicit identifiers would show stronger IF under the hypothetical intervention is 83\%, but the implied effect sizes are substantively negligible.
Thus, despite the slight directional tendency, the evidence aligns more closely with H2b (no discernible amplification from explicit identity) than with H2a.

Outgroup derogation yields the clearest indication of equivalence.
Explicit partisans withhold 0.45 tokens from out-partisans (95\% CrI: 0.36, 0.54), nearly identical to implicit partisans (0.48; 95\% CrI: 0.35, 0.60).
The causal effect is essentially null (CATE = -0.03; 95\% CrI: -0.16, 0.10).
If anything, the posterior slightly favors greater derogation among implicit partisans (Pr(CATE < 0) = 0.67), though again the magnitudes are trivial.
These results directly contradict H3a and instead support H3b, which posits no additional derogatory behavior from explicit identity.

Viewed jointly, the dictator-game evidence suggests that explicitly endorsing a partisan identity adds little to the behavioral AP dynamics already present among implicit partisans.
Posterior medians near zero, symmetric uncertainty, and concentration around substantively small effects all indicate that --- under the intervention logic motivating our estimand --- explicit identification does not meaningfully amplify partisan discrimination.
Instead, the behavioral expression of AP appears grounded in categorization and partisan anchoring, consistent with theoretical accounts that emphasize informational or norm-based mechanisms rather than subjective self-placement.
We next examine whether this pattern extends to the trust game, where reciprocal structure may alter the relative contribution of ingroup and outgroup components.

#### Trust game {.unnumbered}

@fig-pooled-cov-t summarizes the pooled trust-game results.
Although the broader conclusion mirrors the dictator game --- limited causal influence of explicit over implicit partisanship --- the component patterns differ in informative ways.
Relative to the dictator game, the trust game produces (i) no directional signal fo AP, (ii) a reversed pattern for IF, and (iii) the clearest support for the hypothesized effect for OD.

{{< embed code/postproduction/06_figures.qmd#fig-pooled-cov-t >}}

For AP, explicit and implicit partisans behave indistinguishably: both allocate 1.08 tokens more to co-partisans (explicit 95\% CrI: 1.00, 1.17; implicit 95\% CrI: 0.89, 1.26).
The estimated causal contrast is centered exactly at zero (CATE = 0.00; 95\% CrI: -0.17, 0.19), producing a posterior split nearly evenly around the null.
This offers no support for H1a in the reciprocal context and is consistent with H1b.

Ingroup favoritism, by contrast, exhibits a modest reversal.
Explicit identifiers reward co-partisans by 0.63 tokens (95\% CrI: 0.53, 0.72), whereas implicit identifiers display a slightly larger premium (0.75; 95\% CrI: 0.53, 0.95).
The resulting causal estimate is negative (CATE = -0.12; 95\% CrI: -0.32, 0.09), with the posterior assigning a probability of 0.86 to implicit partisans favoring co-partisans *more* strongly.
Although small, this direction reverses the dictator-game tendency and suggests that reciprocal incentives can alter the structure of group-based benefits.
The evidence therefore contradicts H2a and aligns with H2b.

Outgroup derogation provides the most supportive trust-game evidence for the hypothesized influence of explicit identification.
Explicit partisans withhold 0.46 tokens (95\% CrI: 0.38, 0.53) from out-partisans, compared with 0.33 among implicit partisans (95\% CrI: 0.21, 0.46).
The causal contrast is positive (CATE = 0.12; 95\% CrI: -0.01, 0.26), and the posterior probability that explicit identifiers derogate more is 97\%.
This is the clearest instance in which results align with H3a.
Yet even here, the substantive magnitude remains limited, and implicit partisans still exhibit meaningful OD; the evidence is supportive but not decisive.

Synthesizing across both games, the findings consistently indicate that explicit self-reported partisanship exerts only small, uncertain, and context-dependent causal effects on discriminatory AP behaviors.
In several cases the directional tendency aligns with the party-over-policy expectations (H1a–H3a), in others it reverses, and in no instance does the estimated effect approach a substantially large magnitude or produce strong posterior certainty.
The lack of convergence across the two behavioral tasks is particularly informative: behaviors attributed to explicit partisan identity do not replicate consistently across allocative and reciprocal environments, undermining the identity-first expectation that subjective attachment reliably intensifies partisan discrimination.

Instead, the pooled findings point to a robust conclusion: individuals who decline to label themselves as partisans nonetheless exhibit levels of AP --- including both favoritism and derogation --- that closely match those of explicit partisans.
Implicit identification alone appears sufficient to generate substantial partisan bias in both behavioral contexts under study, as posited by the cue-based and categorization pathways underlying H1b–H3b.

Finally, the trust-game evidence underscores a key measurement implication.
Aggregate AP can mask compensating differences in IF and OD.
As observed here, similar levels of AP can arise from distinct combinations of its components, potentially obscuring theoretically relevant heterogeneity.
Analyses relying solely on co-partisan versus out-partisan contrasts may therefore miss meaningful variation in the underlying mechanisms of affective polarization.

### Do explicit and implicit partisans differ across countries?

We next examine whether the effect of partisan type varies across national contexts.
If the causal influence of explicit identity depends on characteristics such as party-system structure, political culture, or the salience of partisan conflict, we would expect meaningfull cross-country variation in the CATE --- especially under hypotheses H1a–H3a.

@fig-country-cov-d-cate presents the country-specific CATE estimates for the dictator game.
Strikingly, each country's posterior distribution is nearly identical to the pooled estimate.
No country exhibits a directional deviation, and the uncertainty intervals overlap almost perfectly.
The trust-game results in @fig-country-cov-t-cate replicate this pattern: the country-level CATEs again mirror the pooled contrasts, with no systematic cross-national dispersion.

Such uniformity initially raises the concern that partial pooling or model specification might have obscured meaningful heterogeneity.
To address this, we turn to the conditional expected values (EVs) that underpin the QoIs and their respective CATEs and examine the underlying behavioral patterns directly.

{{< embed code/postproduction/06_figures.qmd#fig-country-cov-d-cate >}}

{{< embed code/postproduction/06_figures.qmd#fig-country-cov-t-cate >}}


In the dictator game (@fig-country-cov-d-ev), clear cross-national differences emerge when comparing across rows.
Countries vary in baseline giving (as indicated by contributions to "None") and in the magnitude of affective polarization and its components (visible as the relative distances between the shaded posteriors associated with co-partisan, neutral, and out-partisan recipients).
These differences demonstrate that the model is not surpressing genuine cross-country variation: respondents in some contexts exhibit more AP, IF, or OD than those in others.

However, when comparing across partisan types within each country (the two columns in each panel), the expected values are virtually indistinguishable.
In every case, implicit and explicit partisans display the same pattern of allocations, differing mainy in posterior precision (implicit types tend to have wider distributions) rather than in their locations.
For example, Ireland exhibits lower overall AP than Spain, but this holds for both implicit and explicit partisans.
The same cross-national ordering --- and the same within-country equality --- appears throughout the sample.
This symmetry explains why the CATEs are identical across countries: while countries differ in how much partisans discriminate, they do not differ in how much *additional* discrimination is associated with explicit identification.

The trust-game EVs in @fig-country-cov-t-ev reinforce this conclusion.
Again, countries differ substantially in aggregate AP and in the composition of IF and OD.
Yet within each country, implicit and explicit identifiers behave nearly identically, with differences emerging only in the variance of their posterior distributions.
The consistency of this pattern across all 25 countries mirrors the pooled estimates.

{{< embed code/postproduction/06_figures.qmd#fig-country-cov-d-ev >}}

{{< embed code/postproduction/06_figures.qmd#fig-country-cov-t-ev >}}

Taken together, the country-level analyses provide strong evidence that the causal effect of shifting from implicit to explicit partisan type is negligible in every national context examined.
Although countries differ in their overall levels of allocative and reciprocal discrimination, the *difference between partisan types* is remarkably stable and effectively zero across all 25 settings.
This conclusion is further supported by the hierarchical model: the estimated country-level standard deviation of the partisan-type slope is very small (dictator game: SD ≈ 0.05; trust game: SD ≈ 0.09), indicating minimal cross-national dispersion in the implicit–explicit contrast.

In sum, while affective polarization itself varies meaningfully across Europe, the behavioral consequences of explicit versus implicit partisan identification do not.
Implicit identification appears sufficient to generate the levels of AP observed in each country, and making partisanship explicit adds little --- if anything --- to the discriminatory behaviors captured in either experimental task, consistent with the cue-based expectations embodied in H1b–H3b rather than the identity-intensification predictions of H1a–H3a.

## Robustness

## Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

This paper asked whether explicit partisan attachment meaningfully conditions affective polarization in European multiparty systems.
Using two behavioral games and a hierarchical reanalysis of a large cross-national conjoint experiment, the evidence points to a consistent answer: across 25 democracies, explicit identifiers do not discriminate more strongly than implicit partisans.
Conditional average treatment effects are extremely small, posterior mass is tightly concentrated near zero, and the sign of the effect varies across settings and behavioral components.
In contrast, implicit partisans --- citizens who reject subjective attachment yet reveal a clear partisan anchor --- exhibit robust ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation in both games. Behavioral AP thus arises reliably even absent self-reported identity.

These findings carry several implications.
First, for measurement and inference, they justify the widespread practice in comparative research of treating vote-anchored respondents and identifiers jointly when estimating behavioral AP.
Restricting analyses to explicit identifiers risks selecting a shrinking and cross-nationally unstable subgroup, thereby shifting the population of inference in ways that are rarely acknowledged.
Distinguishing partisan type helps clarify when such shifts occur and provides a generalizable framework for comparative AP measurement.

Second, the results speak to theories of partisan identity.
The standard PID attachment item captures only one dimension of partisanship and appears only weakly related to discriminatory behavior in these tasks.
Consistent with recent multidimensional and cue-based theories, behavioral AP in Europe seems to emerge primarily from latent identity, categorization, and substantive inferences that respondents draw from party labels—not from the strength of self-reported attachment.
Identity-like behaviors do not presuppose identity-strength, and behavioral forms of AP do not map cleanly onto subjective identification.

Third, the cross-national consistency of the null effect is itself noteworthy.
The meaning of explicit identification, and the prevalence of identifiers, vary widely across European electorates, yet the conditional effect of explicit identity on AP is remarkably stable: near zero in every country.
This pattern suggests a broadly shared mechanism of partisan cue processing that operates similarly across party systems and underscores how multiparty environments structure partisan identity differently than the two-party U.S. context.

Methodologically, the study demonstrates how conjoint experiments combined with Bayesian hierarchical modeling enable researchers to decompose AP into ingroup and outgroup components while accommodating heterogeneous partisan structures.
This design yields strong causal leverage on cue effects and provides a template for estimating AP in comparative settings where the meaning of “partisan” varies.

At the same time, limitations remain.
Behavioral AP captures only one dimension of a broader construct and it remains to be seen if our findings hold for other indicators, e.g. thermometer ratings, social distance, or elite-focused affect, which may lead to different conclusions.
The single-item PID measure is noisy, and richer batteries could sharpen the definition of partisan types.
Our design is cross-sectional and cannot adjudicate the dynamics of identity formation.
Finally, our interpretation --- that the absence of explicit-identity effects supports a policy-over-party rather than party-over-policy mechanism --- rests on the assumption that the attachment item accurately captures respondents’ self-concepts, an assumption that may not hold uniformly across contexts.

These caveats notwithstanding, the central conclusion is clear.
Partisan identity is real, but it is not reducible to reported subjective attachment.
Implicit partisanship—the behavioral anchor that shapes categorization and substantive expectations—carries sufficient informational and social content to generate the same discriminatory behaviors as explicit identity.
This challenges identity-only accounts of affective polarization and strengthens the case for multidimensional, cue-driven models of partisan behavior in comparative politics.

### Experimental setup {.appendix}

Before the behavioral games, @hahm2024divided presented respondents a short background information overview and instructions. For the dictator game, these were: *This game is played by pairs of individuals.* *Each pair is made up of a Player 1 and a Player 2.* *Each player will have some information about the other player, but you will not be told who the other players are during or after the experiment.* *The game is conducted as follows: A sum of 10 tokens will be provisionally allocated to Player 1 at the start of each round.* *Player 1 will then decide how much of the 10 tokens to offer to Player 2.* *Player 1 could give some, all, or none of the 10 tokens.* *Player 1 keeps all tokens not given to Player 2.* *Player 2 gets to keep all the tokens Player 1 offers.* *You will play this game three times with three different people.* In the trust game, the provided information and instruction were: *This game is played by pairs of individuals.* *Each pair is made up of a Player 1 and a Player 2.* *Each player will have some information about the other player, but you will not be told who the other players are during or after the experiment.* *Each player will receive 10 tokens.* *Player 1 then has the opportunity to give a portion of his or her 10 tokens to Player 2.* *Player 1 could give some, all, or none of the 10 tokens.* *Whatever amount Player 1 decides to give to Player 2 will be tripled before it is passed on to Player 2.* *Player 2 then has the option of returning any portion of this tripled amount to Player 1.* *Then, the game is over.* *Player 1 receives whatever he or she keeps from the original 10 tokens, plus anything returned to him or her by Player 2. Player 2 receives their original 10 tokens, plus whatever he or she keeps after returning any portion of the tripled amount to Player 1.* *You will play this game three times, with three different people.* *The more tokens you obtain, the more successful you will be.*

In both games respondents were shown a tabular overview of Player 2 after the instructions. @fig-example-profile shows an example of such a profile along with the interface respondents were provided to assign the 10 tokens. Each round, a new profile was displayed to respondents.
