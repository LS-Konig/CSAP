  How does partisan type influence affective polarization?
subtitle: |
  A comparative study of 25 European democracies
abstract: |
  This study introduces the concept of partisan *type*, which distinguishies *explicit* partisans -- respondents who explicitly report attachement to a political party -- from *implicit* partisans, namely respondents who explicitly report no attachement, but still express a partisan preference in standard voting items.
  Existing studies on affective polarization often use measures that either restrict analyses to the former type or combine both when trying to infer the state of affective polarization in a given context.
  This study explores empirically if there are systematic differences between explicit and implicit partisans regarding their affective polarization behavior, reanalyzing experimental data from 25 European multi-party systems.
  Results show that 1) shares of explicit partisans vary from 45% to 85%,
  2) implicit partisans show almost identical levels of affective polarization,
  3) lower levels of IF and OD
  4) this holds across countries.
  The implications are that scholars need to carefully consider what their population of interest is when measuring affective polarization, as context-specific differences in the relative distributions of partisan types may yield biased inferences about the state or dynamic of polarization in a given society.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

How does partisan type shape affective polarization?
Despite an extensive and rapidly growing literature on affective polarization (AP), fundamental ambiguity remains regarding who is—and is not—the population of inference in many studies.
A substantial portion of existing measures and designs implicitly restrict the analytical sample to partisan identifiers, while others include all respondents regardless of their subjective partisan attachment.
Yet both strategies aim to make claims about the state or trajectory of affective polarization in a society.
When inferences are drawn exclusively from partisan subsamples, valid population-level generalizations hinge on strong assumptions about the size and representativeness of that subset.
Only when partisan identifiers (a) comprise a sufficiently large share of the electorate or (b) accurately represent non-identifiers can such extrapolations hold.

This study addresses these conceptual and empirical gaps by introducing partisan type as an analytically distinct dimension that separates explicit partisans --- those who report subjective attachment to a party --- from implicit partisans—those who express a vote preference but explicitly reject partisan attachment.
While prior work in the U.S. context [e.g., @theodoridis2017me; @elliott2024like] has theorized differences between identification, closeness, and related constructs, the distinction has rarely been leveraged to assess the population of inference in comparative studies of AP, nor systematically examined in multiparty systems.

I make four contributions.
First, I refine the conceptual foundations of affective polarization by clarifying how different partisan types map onto populations of inference, a distinction particularly crucial in European multiparty contexts where the prevalence and meaning of partisan identifiers vary widely.
Second, I provide the first cross-national empirical assessment of the distribution of partisan types across 25 European democracies.
Third, using hierarchical Bayesian models, I estimate the causal effect of partisan type on affective polarization: How would AP change if a respondent’s partisan type were (hypothetically) shifted from implicit to explicit, holding all else constant?
Finally, I place these results in comparative perspective, assessing whether the relationship between partisan type and AP varies across national contexts.

The theoretical expectation follows directly from social identity theory: because affective polarization operates through group-based identity and subjective attachment, explicit partisans should display stronger in-group favoritism and more pronounced out-group derogation than implicit partisans. The key question is whether this mechanism is exclusive to explicit identifiers or whether—even in the absence of subjective attachment—implicit partisans also exhibit affective polarization, implying a deeper and more complex identity process.

tba: results
Although theories of party system fragmentation, political culture, and mobilization suggest plausible cross-country differences, the findings indicate a remarkably consistent pattern across all 25 democracies studied.

Paragraph on implications (conditional on results)

If implicit partisans polarized too -\> suggests social identity mechanism despite clear rejection of subjective attachement -\> identity complex

Differences -\> approaches like @hahm2024divided less suited to infer about state of polarization in a given country context

Pooled results show no substantial difference in the estimated levels of AP between implicit and explicit partisans.

However, there seems to be differences in the composition

Given the similarities in affective polarization behavior, I conclude that partisan identity goes beyond the reporting of an subjective attachement to a political party, or that this survey item is not ideal for capturing partisan identities.

## Theory {#sec-theory}

### Affective polarization and its identity foundations

-   surge in AP studies
Drawing on social identity (SIT) and self-categorization theory (SCT), the study of affective polarization (AP) has gained considereable attention in the recent decade since @iyengar2012affect's seminal paper establishing the affective perspective on polarization.
In general terms, AP refers to the tendency of humans to exhibit warmer feelings towards members of their own, perceived group (in-group favoritism), while disliking those perceived as belonging to another group (out-group derogation).
While fundamentally a universal human phenomenon, the recent surge in publications in the political and social sciences is mostly focussing on AP in the context of political or politically salient group identities, the most important of which is partisanship.

- Briefly summarise AP's rise since @iyengar2012affect
- Define AP as ingrou favoritism + outgroup derogation
- Emphasize the identity mechanism at the core of AP (SIT & SCT)
- Hightlight that AP is a general identity phenomenon, but political identities have become the central focus

### Partisanship as social identity

-   Partisanship as social identity
Unlike earlier accounts of partisanship as a rational, preference and ideology based choice -- the *instrumental* model of partisanship --, the SIT perspective boosted the *expressive* model of partisanship, conceptualizing it as an identity.
Research further distinguished expressive partisanship into *positive* and *negative* partisan identities.
Former captures a citizen's identification *with* a certain political party, whereas the latter in contrast refers to a citizen's identification *against* a party, as not being part of that group.

- Contrast instrumental (Downs) vs expressive/social-identity-based partisanship
- Introduce positive and negative partisan identity
- Note the emergin literature distinguishing:
  - identifiers vs non-identifiers
  - closeness vs identification
  - identity strength
  - implicit identity activation

These literatures discuss components of identity but do not systematize how *subjective attachement* vs *non-attachement* affects AP in multiparty contexts.

### The measurement problem: Who counts as a partisan?

- AP measures in multiparty contexts differ fundamentally in whose feelings are measured
  - Reiljan's API: identifiers only
  - Wagner's API: whole electorate
  - Multiple-ingroup models

- These choices implicitly assume something about:
  - The scope of partisanship
  - the population of inference
  - the comparability of AP levels across systems

Because identifiers vary dramatically across countries, restricting measures to identifiers creates conceptual and inferential instability.

### Introducting *Partisan Type* Explicit vs Implicit Partisanship

Building on insights from the U.S. literature on implicit vs explicit identity, I refine this distinction for comparative multiparty settings by distinguishing between:
  - *explicit partisans*: respondents reporting subjective partisan attachement
  - *implicit partisans*: respondents who explicitly deny attachement but still express a preference (e.g. in vote choice or other items)
In literature this sometimes is referred to as partisan leaners, but I think this concept of partisan type is useful to systematically and analytically combine the related thoughts of leaners, closeness and identity.  
I also contest that it is more accurate in that identity itself is a complex concept, and my proposal incorporates the notion that partisan leaners do in fact identify to some degree with the party, even if potentially less than explicit identifiers.
Still, this captures a nuanced understanding that there are differing degrees of identification with a party, and explicitly reporting subjective attachement is just one of them.
I have to acknowledge that many survey in fact have more comlex sets of items to capture partisan identities using follow up question, which allows for identification of partisan leaners.
Yet and to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated whether explicit partisans differ systematically from those stating they do not feel attached with respect to AP in multiparty systems. 
This distinction is conceptually simple but substantively important for AP reseach in multiparty systems because sample restrictions imply different populations of inference.
Yet no comparative study systematically evaluates: (1) whether these types differ in their affective responses, and (2) how their prevalence varies across countries.
Whether these theoretical considerations come with empirical implicatios is subject of this study.

### Why partisan type should matter for affective polarization

- Explicit partisans -> stronger identification -> stronger AP
- Mechanisms:
  - motivates social categorization
  - group-based affect
  - perceived threat
  - reinforcement through party system cues
- Implicit partisans -> weaker group attachement but still possess:
  - directional preferences
  - political predispositions
  - potential latent identity

If implicit partisans are similarly polarized as explicit ones, this suggest AP is not simply a byproduct of subjective attachement, but that a broader identity or heuristic mechanism.

### Hypotheses

$H_1:$ Explicit partisans exhibit higher affective polarization than implicit partisans.
$H_2:$ Explicit partisans show greater in-group favoritism than implicit partisans.
$H_3:$ Explicit partisans show stronger

## Research design {#sec-design}

In this section, we detail our empirical strategy for identifying the effect of partisan type on AP.
We begin by introducing the dataset and describing the experimental design, emphasizing its advantages for measuring AP.
We then outline the key variables of interest and present a directed acyclical graph (DAG) that summarizes our causal model of the data-generating process.
Next, we specify the statistical model and explain how we obtain the quantities of interest, followed by a justification of our covariate set.
Finally, we enumerate the assumptions required for causal interpretataion and situate our design and modeling strategy within the broader literature, highlighting both strengths and its remaining limitations.

### Data and experimental setup {#sec-data}

To evaluate how different partisan types influence AP, we reanalyze the cross-national conjoint experiment conducted by @hahm2024divided.
The study was fielded by Dynata (formerly SSI) in 25 EU member states between late May and mid-August 2019.[^countries] 
National samples consist of approximately 1,200 respondents per country (29,827 in total), drawn to be broadly representative on key sociodemographic dimensions.
Summary statistics appear in table XX in the appendix.

[^countries]: The countries covered are all EU member states (which included the UK at the time of data collection) except Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus.

The experiment comprised two behavioral games: a dictator game capturing unilateral prosociality and a trust game introducing reciprocal incentives.[^games]
In each round, respondents interacted with a hypothetical partner whose attributes --- age, gender, class, religion, nationality, and partisanship --- were independently randomized.
Each respondent completed three rounds of each game, yielding six observations per participant.
Our unit of analysis is thus a single game round.
The resulting data are inherently nested: multiple rounds within respondents, respondents nested within party affiliations, and respondents and parties clustered within countries.
We therefore rely on hierarchical models, described in detail in the section @sec-model.

[^games]: Detailed information, instruction wording and an exemplary profile are presented in the appendix.

These behavioral measures offer several advantages for studying affective polarization.
First, the design is explicitly suited to assessing *horizontal* AP among mass partisans [@areal2024verticalvshorizontal].
Common observational indicators --- such as like/dislike scales or feeling thermometers --- conflate horizontal evaluations of fellow citizens with *vertical* evaluations of party elites, thereby limiting their interpretability [@druckman2019we].
Second, the inclusion of a nonpartisan baseline condition enables us to causally decompose AP into its constituent components: ingroup favoritism (IF) toward co-partisans and outgroup derogation (OD) toward rival partisans.
We estimate these components using standard conjoint estimands that capture the average marginal effect of each attribute on token allocations [@hainmueller2014causal].

Third, respondents hold multiple, potentially cross-cutting social identities [@roccas2002social].
The randomized conjoint design mitigates bias arising from such heterogeneity by independently varying several attributes that might otherwise be confounded with partisan cues.
This feature allows us to isolate the specific effect of partisanship and reduces the risks of "aliasing" [@hainmueller2014causal] and "masking" [@bansak2021conjoint], which occur when omitted attributes correlate with treatment dimensions [@dafoe2018information].[^aliasing] 
Finally, by embedding partisan information among multiple randomized cues, conjoint tasks are less susceptible to social desirability pressures than direct survey questions [@horiuchi2022does].

[^aliasing]: Naturally, a conjoint design can only include a limited set of attributes and therefore cannot preclude all forms of aliasing; we make no claim to exhaustiveness. Nonetheless, by randomizing several plausibly correlated characteristics (e.g., age, gender), the design reduces the risk that inferences about partisanship merely reflect respondents' assumptions about the social composition of party supporters. In this respect, it is substantially less susceptible to the confounding that affects like/dislike scales or feeling thermometers, which cannot disentangle the effect of partisanship from correlated beliefs about associated social groups.


### Construction of main variables {#sec-vars}

We construct our main variables of interest following a tripartite framework to ensure conceptual coherence and terminological consistency in all party-related measures.
First, we define $T_i$ as the *partisan type* of respondent $i$.
If respondent $i$ reported a party to which she feels attached to and is thus considered an *explicit* partisan, we define $T_i = 1$. 
Conversely, we set $T_i = 0$ for *implicit* partisans, i.e., respondent $i$ who indicated no partisan attachement but reported a vote preference.
We term the party reported by respondents *partisan anchor* $A_i$.[^anchor]

[^anchor]: We use the term *partisan anchor* to denote the party reference point reported by respondents, regardless of whether they express subjective attachment to that party. For explicit partisans, this anchor corresponds to the conventional *partisan ingroup* in the literature (as in @hahm2024divided). For implicit partisans, however, respondents explicitly deny a felt attachment, making social-identity terminology inappropriate. The term *anchor* therefore provides a neutral label that applies consistently across both groups.


In the experiment, each conjoint profile in round $r$ contains a randomized party cue ($Z^{party}_{r}$).
We compare this cue to the respondent's anchor to classify the *partisan relationship* $R_{ri}$ as co-partisan, out-partisan, or neutral ($R_{ri} \in \{Co, Out, None\}$).
This coding corresponds to the "average across out-groups" operationalization and offers a tractable strategy for multi-party contexts, although it constitutes a substantial reduction of real-world complexity in multi-party systems.
We adopt this measure as it provides a uniform and comparable classification scheme across countries.

We conceptually frame explicit partisanship as the treatment and implicit partisanship as a control.
Respondents reporting a subjective attachement to a political party ($T_i = 1$) thus form the treated group, whereas respondents expressing vote choice without attachement ($T_i = 0$) constitute the comparison group.[^quasi]
The underlying research question is: Does explicit partisan attachement amplify affective polarization relative to implicit partisan attachement?
In causal terms, we ask how a hypothetical intervention shifting $T$ from 0 to 1 would change affective polarization, holding other factors constant.

[^quasi]: For readability, we omit the prefix "quasi-" when referring to treatment and control, without implying random assignement. Our design remains observational with respect to our treatment of interest, partisan type $T$.

@fig-dag depicts the underlying causal data-generating process as a directed acyclical graph (DAG).
As noted above, respondents report a partisan anchor $A$.
Partisan type $T$ is defined only for the subset of respondents who either explicitly or implicitly report a party and therefore appears as a child node of $A$.
In each round $r$ of the conjoint games, respondents receive a set of conjoint attributes, denoted by $Z_r$.
The partisan cue $Z_r^{\text{party}}$ and respondents' anchors $A_i$ jointly determine the partisan relationship category via the mapping $f:(A_i, Z_r^{\text{party}} \mapsto R_{ij} \in \{\text{Co}, \text{Out}, \text{None}\})$.

The dependent variable $Y_{riac}$ is the token allocation made in round $r$ by respondent $i$ with anchor $a$ from country $c$.
Token allocations $Y$ are affected by both $R$ and $Z_r^{\text{other}}$, with the effect of $R$ theorized to be conditional on $T$.
Because $T$ is observational, we cannot assume conditional independence.
We therefore include $C$ to capture individual-level confounders affecting both $T$ and $Y$.
Graphically, our substantive interest lies in the causal chain $T \to R \to Y$, namely the effect of $R$ on $Y$ conditional on $T$, represented as the central vertical path in @fig-dag.

{{< embed code/preparation/02_descr_anal.qmd#fig-dag >}}

### Model specification {#sec-model}

We model the data in their natural hierarchical structure.
The unit of analysis is a single conjoint profile evaluation in round $r$ of a game.
Profile evaluations ($r$) are nested within respondents ($i$), respondents are grouped by their partisan anchors ($a$), i.e., the party to which they report attachement or vote intention, and anchors are nested within countries ($c$).
This yields a four-level structure: Level 1 (round $r$) $\mapsto$ Level 2 (respondent $i$) $\mapsto$ Level 3 (anchor a) $\mapsto$ Level 4 (country c).

Let $Y_{riac}$ denote the number of tokens allocated (0-10) in round $r$ by respondent $i$ with partisan anchor $a$ in country $c$.
Respondent partisan type is $T_i \in \{0,1\}$ (implicit vs explicit).
The respondent-profile partisan relationship $R_{ri} \in \{\text{Co, Out, None}\}$ is a deterministic function of the respondent's anchor and the profiles partisan cue.
$Z_{r}^{\text{other}}$ denotes the vector of all other conjoint attributes, and $C_i$ constitutes a vector of respondent-level covariates discussed in @sec-covariates.

To estimate how explicit partisan type conditions responsiveness to partisan cues, we specify a multilevel model with a cross-level interaction between $T_i$ and $R_{ri}$ and random effects at the respondent, anchor, and country levels, as shown in @eq-model-sys:

\singlespacing

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{riac}
&= \beta_0
  + \beta_1 T_i
  + \beta_2 R_{ri}
  + \beta_3 (T_i \times R_{ri})
  + \beta_4 Z^{\text{other}}_{ri}
  + \beta_5 C_i \\
&\quad
  + u_{i0} \\
&\quad
  + v_{a0} + v_{aT} T_i + v_{aR} R_{ri} \\
&\quad
  + w_{c0} + w_{cT} T_i + w_{cR} R_{ri} \\
&\quad
  + \varepsilon_{riac}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-model-sys}
\doublespacing

\noindent We assume a Gaussian likelihood for the bounded but approximately continuous token outcome, allowing effects to be interpreted on the original allocation scale. Respondent-level random intercepts are assumed to follow a normal distribution (@eq-resp-int):

$$
u_{i0} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{u0})
$$ {#eq-resp-int}

\noindent To capture heterogeneous treatment and cue effects, we include a random intercept and random slopes for $T$ and $R$ at the partisan anchor level. These random effects are assumed to be jointly normal (@eq-re-anchor), with intercepts and slopes allowed to be correlated:

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
v_{a0} \\ v_{aT} \\ v_{aR}
\end{pmatrix}
\sim
\mathcal{N}\!\left(
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix},
\Sigma_a
\right),
$$ {#eq-re-anchor}
\doublespacing

\noindent Similarly, we include random intercepts and random slopes for $T$ and $R$ at the country level, also assumed to be jointly normal (@eq-re-country):

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
w_{c0} \\ w_{cT} \\ w_{cR}
\end{pmatrix}
\sim
\mathcal{N}\!\left(
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix},
\Sigma_c
\right),
$$ {#eq-re-country}
\doublespacing

\noindent Both $\Sigma_a$ and $\Sigma_c$ are unstructured $3 \times 3$ covariance matrices, allowing intercepts and slopes to be estimated as correlated at the anchor and country levels.
Residuals are assumed to be normally distributed around $0$ (@eq-error):
$$
\varepsilon_{riac} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2).
$$ {#eq-error}

The interaction $\beta_3(T_i \times R_{ri})$ is the key parameter: it captures how explicit partisan type ($T_i = 1$) conditions sensitivity to co-, out- and nonpartisan cues ($R_{ri}).
Because all profile attributes -- including the partisan cue -- are randomized within respondents, $R_{ri}$ varies as-if at random conditional on $A_i$, supporting causal interpretation of cue effects within each partisan type.
We allow the effect of $R_{ri}$ to vary across partisan anchors ($v_{aR}$) and across countries ($w_{cR}$) to capture heterogeneity plausibly structured by party and national context.
Put differently, the magnitude of affective polarization and its subcomponent likely varies across parties and across countries, and the random slopes are designed to account for this structure.
Similarly, the effect of $T_i$ is allowed to vary across partisan anchors ($v_{aT}$) and countries ($w_{cT}$), reflecting that the meaning and salience of explicit attachement differ across parties and settings.
Respondent-level heterogeneity in baseline generosity is captured by the random intercept $u_{i0}$.
We do not include respondent-level random slopes for $R_{ri}$ [@heisig2019you], because within-respondent variation in partisan-relationship categories is insufficient to reliably estimate individual-specific cue sensitivities.
Excluding this slope shifts heterogeneity in cue sensitivity to the anchor and country levels, remaining individual-level variation is absorbed by higher-level and residual variances.
The correlated random-effects structure enables partial pooling, stabilizing heterogeneous treatment and cue-effect estimates while preserving systematic contextual variation.

We estimate the model in a Bayesian framework via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation implemented in Stan [@rstan] using the `brms` package in R [@burkner2017brms; @burkner2017advanced; @burkner2021bayesian].
This approach propagates uncertainty through the multilevel interaction structure and regularizes the maximal random-effects specification through priors.
Our priors are weakly informative and tailored to the 0-10 outcome scale.
Fixed-effect parameters ($\beta_k$) receive $\mathcal{N}(0, 2)$ priors, which center effects at zero while constraining 95\% of prior mass to approximately $\pm 4$ tokens --- a substantively large shift (40\% of the scale) given the findings of @hahm2024divided.
The model intercept receives a $\mathcal{N}(5, 2)$ prior centered at the midpoint of the token scale.
Standard deviations of the random effects $\sigma_{RE}$ are assigned $\text{student-}t(3, 0, 1)$ priors, which are defined on the positive domain and have heavier tails, allowing for the possibility of larger group-level variability.
The residual standard deviation $\sigma$ is assigned a $\text{student-}t(3, 0, 2)$ prior.
These priors improve convergance, facilitate shrinkage in a high-dimensional multilevel structure, and reduce the probability of implausible prior-predictive draws (e.g., $Y > 10$).

The randomized conjoint design secures internal validity for profile-level effects ($R_{ri}$ and other $Z$ attributes) within partisan types.
The contrast across partisan types (i.e, the effect of $R$ conditional on $T$) remains observational and is identified under adjustmend for $C_i$ and the multilevel structure.
Our hierarchical specification -- allowing anchor- and country-varying slopes -- and weakly informative priors stabilize these comparisons while transparently reflecting remaining uncertainty in the posterior.


### Quantities of interest

In the following sections we define our substantive quantities of interest, affective polarization and its subcomponents, ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. Our substantive interest concerns the differences in these three measures between implicit and explicit partisan types. In the causal framing, we want to unravel the effect of a hypothetical intervention: If we hold all covariates constant and only change $T$ from $0$ to $1$, how does this impact our quantities of interest?

#### Affective polarization

More precisely, we define affective polarization as the difference in expected token allocated in the conjoint games to co-partisans and out-partisans. This approach follows (?) Wagner (or Reiljan) in that it averages across all outgroups, which is a simplification given we are dealing with multi-party systems. Nevertheless, this (CHECK) yields a conservative measure, and allows for cross-national comparisons, as the number of parties in a given national party system varies, and so does the potential number of political outgroups.

Formally, we define affective polarization $AP$ as:

$$
AP = E(Y \mid R = Co) - E(Y \mid R = Out)
$$

These conditional expectations are further refined to capture the effect of explicit attachement:

$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{AP} &= AP_{T=1} - AP_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = Out,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = Out, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$

With the formulated hypothesis above, we posit that $CATE_{AP} > 0$: We expect respondents with explicit partisan type ($T=1$) to exhibit higher levels of affective polarization than implicit types ($T=0$).

#### Ingroup favoritms

Do disentangle affective polarization into ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation, we utilize that the conjoint setup included a neutral control group, in which no partisan cue was displayed ($R = None$). This allows as to estimate the effects of a copartisan cue ($R = Co$) relative to that neutral baseline, conditional on partisan type $T$.

Formally, we define ingroup favoritism $IF$ as:

$$
IF = E(Y \mid R = Co) - E(Y \mid R = None)
$$

further refining this equation with respect to partisan type $T$, we define our causal estimand as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{IF} &= IF_{T=1} - IF_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = None,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = None, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Outgroup derogation

Similarly, the neutral control group ($R = None$) lets us estimate outgroup derogation as the average number in tokens withheld from outpartisans compared to the baseline condition.

Hence, we formalize outgroup derogation $OR$ as

$$
OR = E(Y \mid R = None) - E(Y \mid R = Out)
$$

the subsequent causal estimand is thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{OR} &= OR_{T=1} - OR_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = None, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = Out,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = None, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = Out, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$

By focusing on expected values, or marginal means, we also ensure our substantive results are not dependent on the choice of reference categories [@leeper2020measuring].

### Control variables {#sec-covariates}

To block potential backdoor paths between partisan type and allocation behavior, we include a comprehensive set of individual level covariates capturing the main dimensions that could jointly predict explicit partisan attachement and generosity in experimental settings.
First, we control for sociodemographic characteristics such as age, gender, education, class, religious affiliation, and urban-rural residence.
Second, we include respondents' political orientations and ideological predispositions, including left-right self-placement, cultural and economic nativism, EU attitudes, and satisfaction with democracy.
Third, we adjust for political interest, engagement, and knowledge.
Fourth, we incorporate attitudes toward parties, elites, and democratic processes, capturing orientations toward the political system that might shape both group attachement and intergroup behavior.
Finally, I include economic evaluations and behavioral dispositions (risk-taking and future discounting) to account for contextual and psychological traits related to baseline generosity.
Together, these covariates represent plausibly relevant confounders and help approximate conditional independence between partisan type and the outcome of interest.
A full list of covariate distributions by partisan type is presented in @tbl-covariate-distr, indicating well balanced treatment and comparison groups.
English translated question wordings are provided in the appendix as well.

### Causal assumptions

Our design treats explicit partisanship ($T=1$) as the treatment and implicit partisanship ($T=0$) as the comparison condition.
The conjoint experiment provides strong design-based leverage: all profile attributes ($Z$), including the partisan cue and the order of attributes, are randomized in each round.
Because the respondent-profile relationship $R_ri$ is a deterministic function of a randomized cue and the respondent's anchor $A$, the profile-level variation that drives AP, IF, and OD is as-if random.
Consequently, the effect of $R$ (and of other randomized attributes) on $Y_{riac}$ are causally identified by design.
The conditioning of partisan type is estimated via the interaction $T \times R$.
Here, identification relies on an observational assumption: conditional independence of T given the covariates C and higher-level structure.
Our multilevel Bayesian model encodes this strategy: respondent random intercepts account for stable individual differences, random slopes for T and R at the party anchor and country level allow heterogenous effects and partial pooling across parties and contexts.
All reported estimands are obtained via g-computation (observed values approach), averaging posterior expected valus over the empirical distribution of covariates and grouping units.

- SUTVA
We assume no interference across respondents and a well-defined treatment.
The survey is individual and anonymous, so cross-respondent spillovers are unlikely.
Within-respondent dependence across rounds is mitigated by randomized profiles and modeled with respondent intercepts.
Treatment consistency is addressed by a precise coding of T and by allowing its effect to vary across parties and countries.

- Conditional independence (ignorability) for T
Given our covariates C, and conditioning on partisan anchor and country via random effects, assignment to T is assumed independent of potential outcomes.
Randomization of Z ensures identification of R's effects, the contrast across T relies on this ignorability assumption.

- Covariate balance
The distributions of observed covariates should be comparable across T=1 and T=0. 
Assessement of covariates based on table XX in the appendix yields a good overall balance between the subgroups.
Furthermore, we stabilize estimation through hierarchical partial pooling, which reduces model variance but does ot itself render the design randomized.

- Common support (overlap)
For observed covariate combinations, both partisan types should occur with positive probability.

Although violations of SUTVA could bias our estimates and cannot be fully outruled, we view large violations as unlikely, given randomization of conjoint cues and order as well as the inclusion of respondent intercept.
The chief threat is residual confounding of T and Y: unmeasured factors might affect both selection into explicit and implicit partisanship and allocation patterns, thereby biasing our CATEs for AP, IF and OD.
Remaining imbalance would increase model dependence.
Limited overlap within specific parties or countries would shift identification onto parametric assumptions and cross-unit pooling.
We mitigate these risks with an extensive covariate set (section XX) and the inclusion of country- and party-varying slopes for T and R.
In the Bayesian framework, uncertainty from estimation and pooling is propagates via the posterior, but uncertainty from identification assumption is not "averaged out".
Consequently, our inferences are model-based and assumption-conditional.

We are confident in the internal validity of profile-level effects (R and Z) and of derived quantities (AP, IF, OD) within a given T, because they rest on random assignement of Z.
The contrast between explicit and implicit partisans (CATEs) is more assumption-intensive.
Our modeling strategy -- rich controls, hierarchical partial pooling across partisan anchors and countries, and g-computation -- substantially reduces, but cannot eliminate, the possibility of unobserved confounding or limited support in some contexts.
We therefore report uncertainty transparently and qualify causal language accordingly.

Our goal is to approximate the hypothetical intervention effect: how AP, IF, and OD would change if a respondent's partisan type were shifted from implicit (T=0) to explicit (T=1), holding other factors constant.
Because T is observational, this interpretation is valid under the assumptions presented above.
We state these limitations explicitly and present the resulting estimates as the best model-based causal approximation permitted by the data and design.


## Empirical analysis

We present our findings in three stages. First, we present the distributions of explicit and implicit partisanship across our included country samples. Next, we present the overall average treatment effects of explicit partisanship on our outcomes of interest. Finally, we present cross-country variation of these pooled results to place our results in a comparative perspective.

#### Dictator game

In the dictator game, aimed at capturing one-shot altruistic allocation behaviors, the data indicate a slight tendency in direction with the theorized expectation.
However, as the CATE on the right hand side shows, this tendency is not very large. 
In fact, there is a 75% probability of explicit partisans showing higher AP than implicit partisans, given the data.
Irrespective of that, the posterior indicates a small difference with 95% of the density being < 0.01, if at all.
The much more interesting finding relates to the absolute levels of AP, shown on the left hand side.
Implicit partisans in fact show almost the same levels of AP, although uncertainty is higher, leading to wider posterior distribution.
With 99% certainty, implicit partisans show AP of more than 0.5 tokens.
Though this might not sound like a lot, this amounts to X% of a standard deviation of the overall token allocation variable.
Still, the scale suggests similar effects on the token allocation.

### Is there context-specific variation?

Country CATE results -\> No, identical across countries

{{< embed code/postproduction/06_figures.qmd#fig-country-cov-d-cate >}}

Given the striking similarity across countries, we present the expected values for the partisan relationship categories by type as well:

Country EV results -\> Observable shifts in general baseline of tokens, but patterns themselves remains constant

{{< embed code/postproduction/06_figures.qmd#fig-country-cov-t-ev >}}

-\> While we hypothesized that the effect of explicit partisan attachment might vary by national political context (e.g., party system fragmentation or political culture), our results show a highly consistent pattern. The Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) of explicit partisanship on affective polarization is statistically indistinguishable across all 25 countries, a finding corroborated by the extremely low variance observed in the country-level random slopes for the Partisan Type×Partisan Relationship interaction term (SD\<0.11).

### Experimental setup {.appendix}

Before the behavioral games, @hahm2024divided presented respondents a short background information overview and instructions.
For the dictator game, these were:
*This game is played by pairs of individuals.*
*Each pair is made up of a Player 1 and a Player 2.*
*Each player will have some information about the other player, but you will not be told who the other players are during or after the experiment.*
*The game is conducted as follows: A sum of 10 tokens will be provisionally allocated to Player 1 at the start of each round.*
*Player 1 will then decide how much of the 10 tokens to offer to Player 2.*
*Player 1 could give some, all, or none of the 10 tokens.*
*Player 1 keeps all tokens not given to Player 2.*
*Player 2 gets to keep all the tokens Player 1 offers.*
*You will play this game three times with three different people.*
In the trust game, the provided information and instruction were:
*This game is played by pairs of individuals.*
*Each pair is made up of a Player 1 and a Player 2.*
*Each player will have some information about the other player, but you will not be told who the other players are during or after the experiment.*
*Each player will receive 10 tokens.*
*Player 1 then has the opportunity to give a portion of his or her 10 tokens to Player 2.*
*Player 1 could give some, all, or none of the 10 tokens.*
*Whatever amount Player 1 decides to give to Player 2 will be tripled before it is passed on to Player 2.*
*Player 2 then has the option of returning any portion of this tripled amount to Player 1.*
*Then, the game is over.*
*Player 1 receives whatever he or she keeps from the original 10 tokens, plus anything returned to him or her by Player 2. Player 2 receives their original 10 tokens, plus whatever he or she keeps after returning any portion of the tripled amount to Player 1.*
*You will play this game three times, with three different people.*
*The more tokens you obtain, the more successful you will be.*

In both games respondents were shown a tabular overview of Player 2 after the instructions. @fig-example-profile shows an example of such a profile along with the interface respondents were provided to assign the 10 tokens. Each round, a new profile was displayed to respondents.
