Respondents vary along two analytically distinct dimensions. First, the partisan type ($T_i$) distinguishes respondents who report subjective partisan attachment (explicit partisans, $T_i=1$) from those who report a vote intention or choice in the absence of attachment (implicit partisans, $T_i = 0$). Second, each respondent is assigned a partisan anchor ($A_i$), defined as the party to which they report either attachment or vote intention. In the conjoint tasks, the party cue of profile $j$ is compared to anchor $A_i$ to generate a partisan relationship category ($R_{ij}∈\{Co,Out,Non\}$). This tripartite structure cleanly separates treatment status, party identity, and respondent–profile relationships, and it allows us to estimate the conditional effect of explicit partisan attachment across parties and countries using a hierarchical model with random effects for respondents, parties, and countries.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Recent advancements in the study of affective polarization point at the importance of clearly defined conceptualization. The seminal work of Iyengar introduced the concept of affective polarization primarily as a contrast to ideological polarization in the debate on political polarization in the US. Since then, a lot of research has been dedicated to studying the causes (why is it a thing), concequences (what does it do or more normatively, why should this be considered a problem or not), and dynamics (how does it change) of affective polarization within and beyond the American case.

This lead to a sharp increase in publications on affective polarization. Along the way the discipline matured regarding its conceptualization, acknowledging the inherent multidimensionality (or at least ambiguity) of the term affective polarization. As XYZ point out, "\[t\]he terms "affective polarization", "partisan polarization", or "partisan affective polarization" have long been used interchangeably in the literature". Similarly, empirical measures of affective polarization are often applied without reflection regarding the conceptual and operationalization choices (make sure its not too much paraphrasing). Some studies focus on partisan subsamples, others include the whole electorate (sample), but little research has investigated whether there are systematic differences.

This study addresses this gap by introducing the analytical distinction between *explicit* partisans and *implicit* partisans, investigating their relative distributions, and studying their differences in affective polarization behavior. By explicit partisans we mean respondents who report a subjective attachement to a political party. We term respondents indicating they do not feel personally attached to any political party, but that reported a vote intention or choice, implicit partisans. Logically, this corresponds to previous studies' differentiating between partisans and supporters, but we believe it to be useful to refer to both as partisans, but two different types. (It may better account for reality's complex nature, overcoming the binary heuristic often applied in social identity theory approaches by overcoming the simple binary distinction of either you are in a group or not, though admittably, we reduce complexities of multi-party systems at the other end when averaging across out-partisans).

Empirically, we aim to isolate the average treatment effect of explicit partisanship on affective polarization. Thus, we conceptually think of reported partisan attachement as the (heterogeneous) treatment, and affective polarization respecitvely its subcomponents, ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation, as the outcome(s). Using hierarchical bayesian modelling and data from 25 European countries, we focus on affective polarization in multi-party systems.

Our results reveal ...

These findings have implications for affective polarization research: When (conceptualizing) and measuring affective polarization, scholars should dedicate some thought onto whether the population of interest, onto which they aim to generalize their findings, consists of *explicit* partisans or the whole electorate of explicit and implicit partisans. Depending on the specific case, these two sets are notably different in terms of size, and drawing inferences based on (explicit) partisan subsamples alone might yield biased conclusions about the overall state of affective polarization in a given society.

## Theory {#sec-theory}

We begin by outlining existing conceptualization and measurements in affective polarization literature, with a focus on studies dedicated to European multi-party systems.

Afterwards, we introduce our analytical distinction and present our argument why inferences based on explicit partisan subsamples encompasses potential for biases in more detail.

Finally, we synthesize existing literature on partisanship and affective polarization to formulate hypothesis about potential differences between explicit and implicit partisans regarding their affective polarization behavior.

Hypotheses:

$H_1$: Explicit partisans exhibit higher levels of affective polarization than implicit partisans.

$H_2$: Explicit partisans exhibit higher levels of ingroup favoritism than implicit partisans.

$H_3$: Explicit partisans exhibit higher levels of outgroup derogation than implicit partisans.

Note that these hypotheses are logically dependent: As ingroup favoritsm and outgroup derogation are two subcomponents that jointly make up affective polarization, if $H_1$ were true, either $H_2$ or $H_3$ or both have to be true by extension.

$H_2$: Explicit partisans exhibit both more ingroup favoritsm and more outgroup derogation than implicit partisans.

## Research design {#sec-design}

This section outlines how we measure affective polarization and its subcomponents, the data we use, and out empirical strategy to estimate the effect of explicit partisanship on our outcomes of interest: affective polarization, ingroup favoritism, and outgroup derogation.

We conceptually frame explicit partisanship as a treatment and implicit partisanship as a control. That is, respondents reporting a subjective attachement to a political party ($T_i = 1$) form the treated group, whereas respondents expressing vote choice without attachement ($T_i = 0) form the comparison group.[^omit-quasi]

[^omit-quasi]: For readability, we omit the prefix "quasi-" when referring to treatment and control, but this does not imply random assignement. Our design remains observational.

The underlying research question is: Does explicit partisan attachement amplify affective polarization relative to implicit partisan attachement?

To approximate causal inference from observational variation, we exploit the following features of the data:

1. Tripartite structure of partisan and profile relationships. Each respondent $i$ is characterized by their *partisan type* ($T_i$) and a *partisan anchor* ($A_i$), which is either the party they feel attached to (explicit partisans, $T_i = 1$) or intend to vote for (implicit partisans, $T_i = 0$). Each conjoint profile presents a party cue ($Z^{party}_{ri}$), which is compared to the respondent's anchor to classify the profile as co-partisan, out-partisan, or neutral ($R_{ri} \in {Co, Out, None}$). This structure separates treatment assignment, i.e., partisan type ($T_i$), respondent identity, i.e., partisan anchor ($A_i$), and profile-level variation ($R_ri$).
2. Randomized conjoint profiles. The profiles' attributes -- including all non-partusab cues $Z^{other}_{ri}$ -- are randomly assigned. This ensures that observed differences in token allocations across $R_ri$ are attributable to profile characteristics rather than respondent selection.
3. Hierarchical variation. Respondents are nested within partisan anchors, which are themselves nested within countries. This allows for multilevel modeling that captures heterogeneity at the respondent, party, and country level.

In this section, we situate our measurement approach of affective polarization, present the used data and out empirical strategie to approximate an isolation of the causal effect of *explicit* partisanship on our outcomes of interest: affective polarization, ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation.

In causal terminology, explicit partisans form our treatment group ($T = 1$), with implicit partisans constituting our control group ($T = 0$).[^1]

The underlying idea is to study the effect of explicit subjective group attachement compared to implicit group attachement on affective polarization. 



The effect of the partisan-group-relative-variable is conditional on the type of partisanship. The partisan-group-relative-variable is itself a function of assigned partisan ingroup of respondents (by attachement for explicit and by vote intention/choice for implicit) and the displayed party affiliation of the conjoint profile.

Respondents vary along two analytically distinct dimensions. First, the partisan type ($T_i$) distinguishes respondents who report subjective partisan attachment (explicit partisans, $T_i=1$) from those who report a vote intention or choice in the absence of attachment (implicit partisans, $T_i = 0$). Second, each respondent is assigned a partisan anchor ($A_i$), defined as the party to which they report either attachment or vote intention. In the conjoint tasks, the party cue of profile $j$ is compared to anchor $A_i$ to generate a partisan relationship category ($R_{ij}∈\{Co,Out,Non\}$). This tripartite structure cleanly separates treatment status, party identity, and respondent–profile relationships, and it allows us to estimate the conditional effect of explicit partisan attachment across parties and countries using a hierarchical model with random effects for respondents, parties, and countries.

### Data {#sec-data}

We analyze data from @hahm2024divided ...

### Variables

Following our theoretical framework outlined before, we now operationalize our main variables.

Our main variable of interest is $T_i = \{1, 0\}$, which denotes the *partisan type* of respondent $i$. Values of $T_i = 1$ indicate explicit partisan type, i.e., respondents who reported a feeling of attachement to any political party. $T_i = 0$ marks implicit partisan types: respondents who actively reported not feeling attached to a political party, but expressed a party preference through a vote choice or intention variable.

Next, each respondent is assigned a *partisan anchor* ($A_i$), namely the party respondents indicated to feel attached to or has (intended to) voted for.

We use $Z_ri$ to denote the conjoint profile's cue presented in round $r$ to respondent $i$. These cues include dimension party, age, class, gender, religion, nationality and in case of the dictator game an EU attachement. $Z^{party}_{ri}$ marks the partisan cue, $Z^{other}_{ri}$ all other conjoint cues.

Given we are interested in the partisan effects, we limit observations to conjoint profiles with the nationality attribute fixed to that of the respective country (i.e., "co-national" from respondents' point of view), since there was never a partisan cue for outnationals to exclude implausible scenarios.

Figure X displays the causal data-generating structure. Respondents possess a partisan anchor $A$, defined as the party they feel close to (explicit partisans) or intend to vote for (implicit partisans). Partisan type $T$ (explicit vs. implicit) is only defined for respondents with a partisan anchor and is therefore a child node of $A$. The conjoint design randomizes all profile attributes. The partisan cue $Z^{party} combines with $A$ to produce the partisan relationship category $R=f(A,Z^{party})$, which determines whether the profile is interpreted as co-partisan, out-partisan, or neutral. Other randomized profile cues $Z^{other}$ affect the outcome directly. Token allocations $Y$ are affected by both $R$ and $Z^{other}$, with the effect of $R$ theorized to be conditional on $T$. Because $T$ is observational, we cannot assume conditional independence a priori, hence $C$ denotes potential confounders of both $T$ and $Y$.

To interpret the path $T \rightarrow R \rightarrow Y$ as the conditional causal effect of $T$, we must establish the following assumptions:

SUTVA -> Treatment outcomes are independent of treatment assignment to other units Y_i(1), Y_i(0)
Conditional Independence -> No confounders influencing T and Y
Covariate Balance -> $E[X \mid T = 1] = E[X \mid T = 0]$ Comparability of T=1 and T=0 
Common Support -> for every respondent, there is a positive probability of being assigned to both the treatment and control groups (fulfilled by subset to respondents with partisan anchor)

### Independent variables {#sec-iv}

We code...

Partisanship

$T = 1$ -> explicit partisanship
$T = 0$ -> implicit partisanship



### Dependent variable {#sec-dv}

Token allocated in the experiment

$Y$

### Control variables {#sec-dv}

### Causal model

Partisan Type -> Partisan Anchor -> Relationship Category -> Allocation

### Statistical model

The unit of observation is the specific profile evaluation (r) by respondent (i) who is nested within their assigned partisan anchor (a), which is itself nested within country (c). Thus, we have observations at Level 1, respondents at Level 2, partisan anchors at Level 3, and countries at Level 4.

Let $Y_{ri}$ be the number of tokens allocated in round $r$ by respondent $i$ of party $p$ in country $c$.

Then, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{riac} 
  &= \beta_0 
   + \beta_1 T_i 
   + \beta_2 R_{ri} 
   + \beta_3 \left(T_i \times R_{ri}\right)
   + \beta_4 Z^{\text{other}}_{ri}
   + \beta_5 C_i \\
  &\quad 
   + u_{i0}            
   + v_{a0} + v_{aT} T_i   
   + w_{c0} + w_{cT} T_i   
   + \varepsilon_{ri}
\end{aligned}
$$

with 

$$
\begin{aligned}
u_{i0} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_u^2), \\
\begin{pmatrix}
v_{a0} \\[4pt]
v_{aT}
\end{pmatrix}
&\sim \mathcal{N}\!\left(
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},
\Sigma_a
\right), \\
\begin{pmatrix}
w_{c0} \\[4pt]
w_{cT}
\end{pmatrix}
&\sim \mathcal{N}\!\left(
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},
\Sigma_c
\right), \\
\varepsilon_{ri} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Quantities of interest

In the following sections we define our substantive quantities of interest, affective polarization and its subcomponents, ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. Our substantive interest concerns the differences in these three measures between implicit and explicit partisan types. In the causal framing, we want to unravel the effect of a hypothetical intervention: If we hold all covariates constant and only change $T$ from $0$ to $1$, how does this impact our quantities of interest? 

#### Affective polarization

More precisely, we define affective polarization as the difference in expected token allocated in the conjoint games to co-partisans and out-partisans. This approach follows (?) Wagner (or Reiljan) in that it averages across all outgroups, which is a simplification given we are dealing with multi-party systems. Nevertheless, this (CHECK) yields a conservative measure, and allows for cross-national comparisons, as the number of parties in a given national party system varies, and so does the potential number of political outgroups.

Formally, we define affective polarization $AP$ as:

$$
AP = E(Y \mid R = Co) - E(Y \mid R = Out)
$$

These conditional expectations are further refined to capture the effect of explicit attachement:

$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{AP} &= AP_{T=1} - AP_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = Out,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = Out, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$

With the formulated hypothesis above, we posit that $CATE_{AP} > 0$: We expect respondents with explicit partisan type ($T=1$) to exhibit higher levels of affective polarization than implicit types ($T=0$).

#### Ingroup favoritms

Do disentangle affective polarization into ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation, we utilize that the conjoint setup included a neutral control group, in which no partisan cue was displayed ($R = None$). This allows as to estimate the effects of a copartisan cue ($R = Co$) relative to that neutral baseline, conditional on partisan type $T$.

Formally, we define ingroup favoritism $IF$ as:

$$
IF = E(Y \mid R = Co) - E(Y \mid R = None)
$$

further refining this equation with respect to partisan type $T$, we define our causal estimand as: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{IF} &= IF_{T=1} - IF_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = None,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = None, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$


#### Outgroup derogation

Similarly, the neutral control group ($R = None$) lets us estimate outgroup derogation as the average number in tokens withheld from outpartisans compared to the baseline condition.

Hence, we formalize outgroup derogation $OR$ as

$$
OR = E(Y \mid R = None) - E(Y \mid R = Out)
$$

the subsequent causal estimand is thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{OR} &= OR_{T=1} - OR_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = None, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = Out,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = None, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = Out, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$

## Empirical analysis {#sec-analysis}

We present our findings in three stages. First, we present the distributions of explicit and implicit partisanship across our included country samples. Next, we present the overall average treatment effects of explicit partisanship on our outcomes of interest. Finally, we present cross-country variation of these pooled results to place our results in a comparative perspective.
