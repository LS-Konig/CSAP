  How does partisan type influence affective polarization?
subtitle: |
  A comparative study of 25 European democracies
abstract: |
  Affective polarization (AP) is increasingly viewed as multidimensional, yet many studies restrict inference to explicit partisans who report subjective attachement.
  In multiparty systems, many politically engaged citizens do not identify with any party, raising the question of whether explicit attachement is necessary for partisan bias.
  I introduce partisan type --- explicit versus implicit partisans (non-identifiers with clear vote anchors) --- and test whether it conditions AP.
  Using a conjoint experiment fielded in 25 European democracies (N~29,800), I combine randomized partisan cues with Bayesian models to estimate AP and its components in two behavioral games.
  Across both, explicit and implicit partisans display nearly identical ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation, with conditional effects centered near zero and consistent across countries.
  These findings imply that self-reported attachement adds little behavioral discriminatory content beyond partisan anchoring, supporting recent arguments that identity and substantive pathways yield similar partisan behaviros and clarifying AP measurement in multiparty contexts.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

1. Problem statement
  - AP is widely studies, but who counts as a partisan varies dramatically across studies
  - Many AP measures implicitly restrict inferene to explicit partisans (PID identifiers), while others include the entire electorate
  - In multiparty Europe, the prevelance of identifiers varies sharply -> population of inference becomes unstable

2. Conceptual motivation
  - The literature increasingly views AP as multidimensional
  - Theories of social identity expect explicit identifiers to polarize more, but identity alone may not drive AP [@orr2023affective]
  - Hence: Is explicit subjective attachement actually the driver of behaviroal AP?

3. Key innovation:
  - Introduce partisan type = explicit vs implicit partisans (vote anchor without felt attachement)
  - Future-proof, generalizable concept beyond U.S. "leaners"
  - Clarifies measurement and inference in multiparty contexts

4. Research questions
  - Do explicit and implicit partisans differ in affective polarization, ingroup favoritism, and outgroup derogation?
  - Does partisan type moderate responses to randomized partisan cues?
  - Does this vary cross-nationally?

5. Summary of approach
  - Reanalysis of 25 country conjoint experiment (29,000 respondents)
  - Profile randomization gives causal leverage on AP (within-type)
  - Bayesian multilevel model estimate the CATE(TxR) contrast

6. Central empirical takeaway
  - Explicit attachement adds little to no additional AP in either dictator or trust games
  - Implicit partisns behave equally polarized despite denying subjective attachement
  - Striking cross-national consistency

7. Contribution statement
  - Measurement: demonstrates that restricting AP analyses to identifiers is unnecessary and potentially distorting
  - Theory: shows the limits of identity-only accounts; supports multidimensional and cue-driven models of AP
  - Comparative inference: partisan anchors, not explicit identity, capture the behaviorally relevant component of partisanship across Europe

## Theory {#sec-theory}

1. Background: Affective polarization as multidimensional
  - Rapid expansion since @iyengar2012affect -> many measures, many conceptualizations
  - @campos2025new: AP is not a single latent construct; different measures capture different processes (emotional, social, behavioral)
  - In behavioral AP (allocations), identity may be only one pathway

2. Partisanship as social identity
  - Classic social identity theory expectations:
    - Explicit identifiers -> stronger ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation
  - Expressive vs instrumental models: identity vs policy alignment
  - BUT: identity strength, closeness, leaners, latent identity all complicacte the picture

3. Measurement problem: Who counts as a partisan?
  - In multiparty settings, \% identifiers varies dramatically (40-80\% in our data)
  - Restricting samples to identifiers implicitly changes the population of inference
  - Eurobarometer and national surveys often capture attachement differently -> conceptual instability

4. Introducing "partisan type"
  - Grabs the core idea from U.S. leaners literature, but generalizes it for multiparty contexts
  - Explicit partisans: report attachement
  - Implicit partisans: deny attachement but express a partisan anchor via intended/reported vote
  - Rationale:
    - Vote anchor = behavioral signal of group alignment
    - Subjective attachement = psychological signal
    - These need not coincide

5. Why partisan type should matter (theoretical expectation)
  - Strong identity pathway: explicit identifiers shoullds exhibit more IF and OD
  - Mechanisms: categorization -> group affect -> threat -> exclusivity -> discrimination

6. Why partisan type may not matter (alternative pathways)
  - Identity loyalty vs substantive alignment produce observationally equivalent behaviors [@orr2023affective]
  - Vote choice carries information about:
    - Ideology
    - Issue positions
    - Social composition of supporters
    - Expected norms of reciprocity
  - Thus implicit partisans may activate the same heuristics as explicit identifiers even without subjective attachement

7. Hypotheses
  - H1: Explicit > implicit in AP
  - H2: Explicit > implicit in IF
  - H3: Explicit > implicit in OD
  - Note: These hypotheses represent the identity-centered expectation, but competing accounts (multidimensional AP, cue-based reasoning, normative expectations) predict null differences

## Research Design {#sec-design}

In this section, we detail our empirical strategy for identifying the effect of partisan type on affective polarization.
We begin by introducing the dataset and experimental design, then describe the construction of partisan types and anchors, including a cross-national overview of their distribution.
This distributional evidence clarifies the scope of the analytical sample and motivates our comparative research design.
We then outline the key variables of interest and present a directed acyclical graph (DAG) that summarizes our causal model of the data-generating process.
Next, we specify the statistical model and explain how we obtain the quantities of interest, followed by a justification of our covariate set.
Finally, we enumerate the assumptions required for causal interpretation and situate our design within the broader literature, highlighting both strengths and remaining limitations.

### Data and Experimental Design {#sec-data}

To evaluate how different partisan types influence AP, we reanalyze the cross-national conjoint experiment conducted by @hahm2024divided.
The study was fielded by Dynata (formerly SSI) in 25 EU member states between late May and mid-August 2019.[^1]
National samples consist of approximately 1,100 respondents per country (29,827 in total), drawn to be broadly representative on key sociodemographic dimensions. 
Summary statistics appear in table XX in the appendix.

[^1]: The countries covered are all EU member states (which included the UK at the time of data collection) except Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus.

The experiment comprised two behavioral games: a dictator game capturing unilateral prosociality and a trust game introducing reciprocal incentives.
As the games capture conceptually distinct behavioral settings, they will be analyzed separately.
In each round, respondents interacted with a hypothetical partner with attributes ranging from age, gender, class, religion, to nationality and partisanship.[^2]
All conjoint attributes, including the partisan cue, were randomized independently with one restriction: partisan labels were displayed only when the profile’s nationality matched the respondent’s own country.
This restriction was implemented to avoid implausible cross-national partisan combinations and maintain realism of the profile space.
As a consequence, our analysis is restricted to the subset of profiles in which the partner is a conational.
Within this restricted set, the control condition corresponds to conational profiles without a displayed partisan label.
These restrictions do not affect randomization of the remaining attributes and preserve the “as-if random” variation in partisan cues among conational partners.
Each respondent completed three rounds of each game, yielding six observations per participant.
Our unit of analysis is thus a single game round.
The resulting data are inherently nested: multiple rounds within respondents, respondents nested within party affiliations, and respondents and parties clustered within countries.
We therefore rely on hierarchical models, described in detail in @sec-model.

[^2]: Detailed information, instruction wording and an exemplary profile are presented in the appendix.

These behavioral measures offer several advantages for studying affective polarization.
First, the design is explicitly suited to assessing *horizontal* AP among mass partisans [@areal2024verticalvshorizontal].
Common observational indicators --- such as like/dislike scales or feeling thermometers --- conflate horizontal evaluations of fellow citizens with *vertical* evaluations of party elites, thereby limiting their interpretability [@druckman2019we].
Second, the inclusion of a nonpartisan baseline condition enables us to causally decompose AP into its constituent components: ingroup favoritism (IF) toward co-partisans and outgroup derogation (OD) toward rival partisans.
We estimate these components using standard conjoint estimands that capture the average marginal effect of each attribute on token allocations [@hainmueller2014causal].

Third, respondents hold multiple, potentially cross-cutting social identities [@roccas2002social].
The randomized conjoint design mitigates bias arising from such heterogeneity by independently varying several attributes that might otherwise be confounded with partisan cues.
This feature allows us to isolate the specific effect of partisanship and reduces the risks of "aliasing" [@hainmueller2014causal] and "masking" [@bansak2021conjoint], which occur when omitted attributes correlate with treatment dimensions [@dafoe2018information].[^3]
Finally, by embedding partisan information among multiple randomized cues, conjoint tasks are less susceptible to social desirability pressures than direct survey questions [@horiuchi2022does].

[^3]: Naturally, a conjoint design can only include a limited set of attributes and therefore cannot preclude all forms of aliasing; we make no claim to exhaustiveness.
Nonetheless, by randomizing several plausibly correlated characteristics (e.g., age, gender), the design reduces the risk that inferences about partisanship merely reflect respondents' assumptions about the social composition of party supporters.
In this respect, it is substantially less susceptible to the confounding that affects like/dislike scales or feeling thermometers, which cannot disentangle the effect of partisanship from correlated beliefs about associated social groups.

### Measurement and Variable Construction {#sec-vars}

We construct our main variables of interest following a tripartite framework to ensure conceptual coherence and terminological consistency in all party-related measures.
First, we define $T_i$ as the *partisan type* of respondent $i$.
If respondent $i$ reported a party to which she feels attached to and is thus considered an *explicit* partisan, we define $T_i = 1$. Conversely, we set $T_i = 0$ for *implicit* partisans, i.e., respondent $i$ who indicated no partisan attachement but reported a vote preference.
We term the party reported by respondents *partisan anchor* $A_i$.[^4]

[^4]: We use the term *partisan anchor* to denote the party reference point reported by respondents, regardless of whether they express subjective attachment to that party. For explicit partisans, this anchor corresponds to the conventional *partisan ingroup* in the literature (as in @hahm2024divided). For implicit partisans, however, respondents explicitly deny a felt attachment, making social-identity terminology inappropriate. The term *anchor* therefore provides a neutral label that applies consistently across both groups.

To evaluate the scope conditions of our design and to clarify the population of inference, we begin by documenting the distribution of partisan types in each of the 25 country samples.
@fig-impl-expl-distribution presents the share of respondents classified as explicit partisans, implicit partisans, and nonpartisans (type undefined).
Two features of these descriptive patterns are substantively important.
First, the proportion of nonpartisans is remarkably stable across countries (ranging mostly between 10 and 15\%, least in Estonia (6\%), most in Croatia (23\%)), suggesting that the exclusion of this group --- required for treatment consistency in our design --- does not introduce systematic cross-national biases in the analytical sample.
Second, and more consequential for our theoretical claims, the balance between explicit and implicit partisans varies dramatically across national contexts.
In some electorates, explicit identifiers constitute the clear majority of partisans (e.g. strongest case being Denmark with 85\% explicit partisans), in others, implicit partisans are equally or even more prevalent (e.g. in Latvia both explicit and implicit partisans account for 45\% of respondents).
This heterogeneity underscores the need for a comparative framework capable of assessing whether implicit and explicit partisans differ systematically in their affective responses.
In short, the figure motivates both the internal validity of our sample restriction and the broader comparative question that animates the study: whether distinct partisan types, whose prevalence differs markedly across countries, exhibit different patterns of affective polarization.

{{< embed code/preparation/01_wrangling.qmd#fig-impl-expl-distribution >}}

In the experiment, each conjoint profile in round $r$ contains a randomized party cue ($Z^{party}_{r}$).
We compare this cue to the respondent's anchor to classify the *partisan relationship* $R_{ri}$ as co-partisan, out-partisan, or neutral ($R_{ri} \in \{Co, Out, None\}$).
This coding corresponds to the "average across out-groups" operationalization and offers a tractable strategy for multi-party contexts, although it constitutes a substantial reduction of real-world complexity in multi-party systems.
We adopt this measure as it provides a uniform and comparable classification scheme across countries.

We conceptually frame explicit partisanship as the treatment and implicit partisanship as a control.
Respondents reporting a subjective attachement to a political party ($T_i = 1$) thus form the treated group, whereas respondents expressing vote choice without attachement ($T_i = 0$) constitute the comparison group.[^5]
The underlying research question is: Does explicit partisan attachement amplify affective polarization relative to implicit partisan attachement?
In causal terms, we ask how a hypothetical intervention shifting $T$ from 0 to 1 would change affective polarization, holding other factors constant.

[^5]: For readability, we omit the prefix "quasi-" when referring to treatment and control, without implying random assignement. Our design remains observational with respect to our treatment of interest, partisan type $T$.

@fig-dag depicts the underlying causal data-generating process as a directed acyclical graph (DAG).
As noted above, respondents report a partisan anchor $A$.
Partisan type $T$ is defined only for the subset of respondents who either explicitly or implicitly report a party and therefore appears as a child node of $A$.
In each round $r$ of the conjoint games, respondents receive a set of conjoint attributes, denoted by $Z_r$.
The partisan cue $Z_r^{\text{party}}$ and respondents' anchors $A_i$ jointly determine the partisan relationship category via the mapping $f:(A_i, Z_r^{\text{party}} \mapsto R_{ij} \in \{\text{Co}, \text{Out}, \text{None}\})$.

The dependent variable $Y_{riac}$ is the token allocation made in round $r$ by respondent $i$ with anchor $a$ from country $c$.
Token allocations $Y$ are affected by both $R$ and $Z_r^{\text{other}}$, with the effect of $R$ theorized to be conditional on $T$.
Because $T$ is observational, we cannot assume conditional independence.
We therefore include $C$ to capture individual-level confounders affecting both $T$ and $Y$.
Graphically, our substantive interest lies in the causal chain $T \to R \to Y$, namely the effect of $R$ on $Y$ conditional on $T$, represented as the central vertical path in @fig-dag.

### Model Specification and Estimation {#sec-model}

We model the data in their natural hierarchical structure.
The unit of analysis is a single conjoint profile evaluation in round $r$ of a game.
Profile evaluations ($r$) are nested within respondents ($i$), respondents are grouped by their partisan anchors ($a$), i.e., the party to which they report attachement or vote intention, and anchors are nested within countries ($c$).
This yields a four-level structure: Level 1 (round $r$) $\to$ Level 2 (respondent $i$) $\to$ Level 3 (anchor a) $\to$ Level 4 (country c).

Let $Y_{riac}$ denote the number of tokens allocated (0-10) in round $r$ by respondent $i$ with partisan anchor $a$ in country $c$.
Respondent partisan type is $T_i \in \{0,1\}$ (implicit vs explicit).
The respondent-profile partisan relationship $R_{ri} \in \{\text{Co, Out, None}\}$ is a deterministic function of the respondent's anchor and the profiles partisan cue.
$Z_{r}^{\text{other}}$ denotes the matrix of all other conjoint attributes, and $C_i$ constitutes a matrix of respondent-level covariates discussed in @sec-covariates.

To estimate how explicit partisan type conditions responsiveness to partisan cues, we specify a multilevel model with a cross-level interaction between $T_i$ and $R_{ri}$ and random effects at the respondent, anchor, and country levels, as shown in @eq-model-sys:

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{riac}
&= \beta_0
  + \beta_1 T_i
  + \beta_2 R_{ri}
  + \beta_3 (T_i \times R_{ri})
  + \beta_4 Z^{\text{other}}_{ri}
  + \beta_5 C_i \\
&\quad
  + u_{i0} \\
&\quad
  + v_{a0} + v_{aT} T_i + v_{aR} R_{ri} \\
&\quad
  + w_{c0} + w_{cT} T_i + w_{cR} R_{ri} \\
&\quad
  + \varepsilon_{riac}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-model-sys} 
\doublespacing

\noindent We assume a Gaussian likelihood for the bounded (0-10, see @fig-distr-y in the appendix) token allocation.
While the discrete nature and strict bounds of the outcome violate the technical assumptions of the Gaussian family (as the distribution is constrained and not continuous), the approach is justified by its focus on the marginal means effects ($AP$, $IF$, $OD$).
The estimator for the regression coefficients derived from this likelihood family is mathematically equivalent to the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator under fixed effects and Normal errors [@wooldridge2010econometric].
Crucially, the OLS estimator provides unbiased and consistent estimates of the conditional mean $E(Y \mid X)$ under large samples, even when the residuals are non-Normal or heteroskedastic, relying on asymptotic properties [@white1980heteroskedasticity].
This pragmatic choice allows for directly interpretable coefficients on the original token allocation scale, avoiding the complexity of nonlinear link functions required by models such.
Furthermore, the inclusion of a rich covariate set and the respondent-level random intercept ($u_{i0}$) helps to absorv substantial structured variance, mitigating the severity of residual non-Normality that often arises from bounding effects.
Respondent-level random intercepts are assumed to follow a normal distribution (@eq-resp-int):

$$
u_{i0} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{u0})
$$ {#eq-resp-int}

\noindent To capture heterogeneous treatment and cue effects, we include a random intercept and random slopes for $T$ and $R$ at the partisan anchor level.
These random effects are assumed to be jointly normal (@eq-re-anchor), with intercepts and slopes allowed to be correlated:

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
v_{a0} \\ v_{aT} \\ v_{aR}
\end{pmatrix}
\sim
\mathcal{N}\!\left(
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix},
\Sigma_a
\right),
$$ {#eq-re-anchor} 
\doublespacing

\noindent Similarly, we include random intercepts and random slopes for $T$ and $R$ at the country level, also assumed to be jointly normal (@eq-re-country):

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
w_{c0} \\ w_{cT} \\ w_{cR}
\end{pmatrix}
\sim
\mathcal{N}\!\left(
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix},
\Sigma_c
\right),
$$ {#eq-re-country} 
\doublespacing

\noindent Both $\Sigma_a$ and $\Sigma_c$ are unstructured $3 \times 3$ covariance matrices, allowing intercepts and slopes to be estimated as correlated at the anchor and country levels.
Residuals are assumed to be normally distributed around $0$ (@eq-error): 
$$
\varepsilon_{riac} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2).
$$ {#eq-error}

The interaction $\beta_3(T_i \times R_{ri})$ is the key parameter: it captures how explicit partisan type ($T_i = 1$) conditions sensitivity to co-, out- and nonpartisan cues ($R_{ri}$).
Because all profile attributes -- including the partisan cue -- are randomized within respondents, $R_{ri}$ varies as-if at random conditional on $A_i$, supporting causal interpretation of cue effects within each partisan type.
We allow the effect of $R_{ri}$ to vary across partisan anchors ($v_{aR}$) and across countries ($w_{cR}$) to capture heterogeneity plausibly structured by party and national context.
Put differently, the magnitude of affective polarization and its subcomponent likely varies across parties and across countries, and the random slopes are designed to account for this structure.
Similarly, the effect of $T_i$ is allowed to vary across partisan anchors ($v_{aT}$) and countries ($w_{cT}$), reflecting that the meaning and salience of explicit attachement differ across parties and settings.
Respondent-level heterogeneity in baseline generosity is captured by the random intercept $u_{i0}$.
We do not include respondent-level random slopes for $R_{ri}$ as recommended by @heisig2019you, because within-respondent variation in partisan-relationship categories is insufficient to reliably estimate individual-specific cue sensitivities.
Excluding this slope shifts heterogeneity in cue sensitivity to the anchor and country levels, remaining individual-level variation is absorbed by higher-level and residual variances.
The correlated random-effects structure enables partial pooling, stabilizing heterogeneous treatment and cue-effect estimates while preserving systematic contextual variation.

We estimate the model in a Bayesian framework via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation implemented in Stan [@rstan] using the `brms` package in R [@burkner2017brms; @burkner2017advanced; @burkner2021bayesian].
This approach propagates uncertainty through the multilevel interaction structure and regularizes the maximal random-effects specification through priors.
Our priors are weakly informative and tailored to the 0-10 outcome scale.
Fixed-effect parameters ($\beta_k$) receive $\mathcal{N}(0, 2)$ priors, which center effects at zero while constraining 95\% of prior mass to approximately $\pm 4$ tokens --- a substantively large shift (40\% of the scale) given the initial findings of @hahm2024divided.
The model intercept receives a $\mathcal{N}(5, 2)$ prior centered at the midpoint of the token scale.
Standard deviations of the random effects $\sigma_{RE}$ are assigned $\text{student-}t(3, 0, 1)$ priors, which are defined on the positive domain and have heavier tails, allowing for the possibility of larger group-level variability.
The residual standard deviation $\sigma$ is assigned a $\text{student-}t(3, 0, 2)$ prior.
These priors improve convergance, facilitate shrinkage in a high-dimensional multilevel structure, and reduce the probability of implausible prior-predictive draws (e.g., $Y > 10$).

The randomized conjoint design secures internal validity for profile-level effects ($R_{ri}$ and other $Z$ attributes) within partisan types.
The contrast across partisan types (i.e, the effect of $R$ conditional on $T$) remains observational and is identified under adjustmend for $C_i$ and the multilevel structure.
Our hierarchical specification -- allowing anchor- and country-varying slopes -- and weakly informative priors stabilize these comparisons while transparently reflecting remaining uncertainty in the posterior.

### Quantities of Interest: AP, IF and OD {#sec-qoi}

In this section we define our three substantive quantities of interest --- AP and its two constituent components, IF and OD.
Our empirical focus lies in comparing these measures across implicit and explicit partisan types.
Framed causally, we aim to recover the effect of a hypothetical intervention: holding all covariates constant, how do these quantities of interest change when $T$ is set from $0$ (implicit type) to $1$ (explicit type)?

We conceptualize affective polarization as the difference in the expected number of tokens allocated to co-partisans versus out-partisans in the conjoint games.
This follows the approach used in prior work (CHECK Wagner Reiljan), which averages across all political outgroups --- a simplification in multi-party systems but one that yields a conservative measure and facilitates cross-national comparison, as both the number of viable parties and the size of the outgroup set vary across countries.
Formally, we define affective polarization $AP$ as:

$$
AP = E(Y \mid R = Co) - E(Y \mid R = Out)
$$ {#eq-ap}

\noindent With respect to partisan type, we define our causal estimand as the conditional average treatment effect:

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{AP} &= AP_{T=1} - AP_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = Out,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = Out, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-cateap}
\doublespacing

To disentangle AP into its components, we exploit the neutral control condition in the conjoint experiment, in which no partisan cue was displayed ($R = \text{None}$).
This allows us to estimate the extent to which co-partisanship increases token allocations relative to a neutral baseline, conditional on $T$.
We define ingroup favoritism $IF$ as:

$$
IF = E(Y \mid R = Co) - E(Y \mid R = None)
$$ {#eq-if}

\noindent Refining this with respect to partisan type yields the causal estimand:

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{IF} &= IF_{T=1} - IF_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = None,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = Co, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = None, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-cateif} 
\doublespacing

The same neutral condition ($R = \text{None}$) also enables estimation of outgroup derogation as the reduction in tokens allocated to out-partisans compared to the baseline.
Outgroup derogation $OD$ is defined as:

$$
OD = E(Y \mid R = None) - E(Y \mid R = Out)
$$ {#eq-od}

\noindent The corresponding causal estimand is:

\singlespacing
$$
\begin{aligned}
CATE_{OD} &= OD_{T=1} - OD_{T=0} \\
          &= [E(Y \mid R = None, T = 1) - E(Y \mid R = Out,T = 1)] \\
          &\quad - [E(Y \mid R = None, T = 0) - E(Y \mid R = Out, T = 0)]
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-cateod} 
\doublespacing

By focusing on expected values (marginal means), we ensure that our substantive results do not depend on arbitrary choices of reference categories [@leeper2020measuring].
Consistent with our hypotheses stated in @sec-ht, we expect all $CATE_{AP, IF, OD} > 0$: respondents with explicit partisan attachements ($T=1$) should display higher affective polarization than implicit types ($T=0$), caused simoultaneously by higher degrees of IF as well as stronger OD.

### Covariates and Confounder Adjustment {#sec-covariates}

To block potential backdoor paths between partisan type and allocation behavior ($C_i$ in @fig-dag), we adjust for a comprehensive set of individual-level covariates capturing the principal dimensions that may jointly predict explicit partisan attachement and prosocial behavior in experimental settings.

First, we include standard sociodemographic characteristics: age, gender, education, social class, religious affiliation, and urban-rural residence.
Second, we control for respondents' political orientations and ideological predispositions, including left-right self-placement, cultural and economic nativism, attitudes toward the EU, and satisfaction with democracy.
Third, we account for political interest, engagement, and knowledge.
Fourth, we incorporate attitudes toward parties, elites, and democratic processes, capturing broader orientations toward the political system that plausibly shape both group attachement and intergroup conduct.
Finally, we include economic evaluations and behavioral despositions (risk-taking and temporal discounting) to adjust for contextual and psychological factors associated with baseline generosity.

Together, these covariates represent substantively plausible confounders and help approximate conditional independence between partisan type and the outcome of interest.
Summary statistics for all covariates by partisan type appear in @tbl-covariate-distr, and English-language questionnaire items are provided in the appendix.

### Identification Strategy and Causal Assumptions

Our empirical strategy aims to estimate the causal effect of explicit partisan type ($T=1$) relative to implicit partisan type ($T=0$) on affective polarization (AP, IF, OD).
The identification approach combines strong internal validity provided by the conjoint experiment for the profile attributes ($Z$) with an extensive model-based adjustmend strategy for the observed contrast across partisan types ($T$).

The conjoint design provides strong leverage: all profile attributes ($Z$) are randomized within each round.
Since the respondent-profile relationship ($R_{ri}$) is a deterministic function of a randomized cue ($Z_r^{\text{party}}$) and the respondent's partisan anchor ($A_i$), the profile-level variation that drives AP, IF, and OF is as-if random.
Consequently, the effect of $R$ (and other randomized attributes) on the token allocation $Y_{riac}$ is causally identified by design, conditional on the respondent's partisan type $T$.

The key identification challenge is the conditioning of cue effects on partisan type, estimated via the interaction $T \times R$.
Identification of this contrast relies on the observational assumption that $T$ is conditionally independent of potential outcomes, given the comprehensive set of covariates $C$ and the full hierarchical structure.
Our modeling strategy is explicitly designed to manage this residual confounding.

We formally state the key assumptions and detail our strategy for addressing the principal threat of unobserved confounding:

#### SUVTA {.unnumbered}

We assume no interference across respondents and a well-defined treatment.
The survey was administered individually and anonymously, rendering cross-respondent spillovers unlikely.
Dependence across rounds within respondents is mitigated by randomized profiles and explicitly modeled via the respondent-level random intercepts.
Treatment consistency is ensured through a precise coding of $T$, exclusion of nonpartisan respondents from the analysis, and by allowing its effect to vary across parties and countries.

#### Conditional Independence (Ignorability) of $T$ {.unnumbered}

Conditional on the set of observed covariates $C$ and the grouping units (partisan anchor, country), assignment to explicit versus implicit partisan type is assumed intependent of potential outcomes.
While randomization of $Z$ secures identification of the effects of $R$, the causal interpretation of the Conditional Average Treatment Effects ($CATE$s) across $T$ rests on this ignorability assumption.

#### Covariate Balance {.unnumbered}

Observed covariates should be comparably distributed across $T=1$ and $T=0$.
Descriptive assessments in @tbl-covariate-distr in the appendix indicate a high degree of distributional symmetry across the two groups.
The medians are identical for 21 out of 23 scaled political and economic variables, suggesting that the regression adjustment (via $\beta_5C_i$) starts from a strong, balanced position, substantially mitigating confounding by observed characteristics.
Categorical sociodemographic variables also show similar proportions, with the main observed difference being that explicit partisans ($T=1$) are more likely to be male (53% vs 43%).

#### Common Support (Overlap) {.unnumbered}

Both partisan types must occur with positive probability for observed covariate profiles across all grouping units.

The principal threat to the causal interpretation of the $CATE$s is residual confounding: unmeasured factors may jointly influence selection into $T$ and allocation behavior $Y$.
We deploy a multilevel strategy that leverages the repeated-measures design to control for unobserved condounding at all three hierarchical levels:

1.  Respondent-level adjustment ($u_{i0}$):
The inclusion of a respondent-level random intercept acts as a powerfull control for all stable, time-invariant, unobserved individual characteristics (e.g., latent personality traits, baseline generosity, or stable intensity of social identity) that may affect both selection into $T$ and the outcome $Y$.
This leverage is fundamental to our observational identification strategy.

2.  Partisan anchor-level adjustment ($v_{a0}, v_{aT}, v_{aR}$): The random effects at the partisan anchor level account for unobserved confounding systematic across party lines.
They absorb average unobserved differences (e.g., party organizational culture or ideological uniformity) that influence both the propensity for explicit attachement ($T$) and baseline prosocioality ($Y$).
The random slopes for $T$ and $R$ further allow the confounding or effect size to vary by party.

3.  Country-level adjustment ($w_{c0}, w_{cT}, w_{cR}$):
The country-level random effects address unobserved confounding operating at the national context level.
This accounts for country-specific factors (e.g., general political climate, institutional trust, or overall polarization intensity) that influences both the prevalence of explicit attachement ($T$) and the general levels of prosocial behavior ($Y$).

Our hierachical Bayesian model encodes this strategy.
All reported estimands are obtained via g-computaion (observed-values approach), averaging posterior expectations over the empirical covariate distribution and relevant grouping units, which propagates uncertainty through the entire multilevel structure.

We are confident in the internal validity of profile-level effects ($R$ and other $Z$ attributes) and of the derived quantities ($AP$, $IF$, $OD$) conditional on $T$. as these rely on random assignement of $Z$.
The contrast between explicit and implicit partisans --- the $CATE$s --- is necessarily more assumption-intensive.
Our modeling strategy, combining rich covariate adjustment and hierarchical partial pooling, substanially reduces, though cannot eliminate, the possibility of unobserved confounding.

Our goal is to approximate the effect of a hypothetical intervention shifting a respondent's partisan type from implicit ($T=0$) to explicit ($T=1$), holding other factors constant.
Because $T$ is observational, this interpretation is valid only under the assumptions outlined above.
We thus present the resulting estimates as the best model-based causal approximation afforded by the available data and the experimental design.

## Empirical analysis

We present our results in the following structure.

In pooled analysis:
  the rows correspond the respective quantities of interest (AP, IF, OD)
  the left column shows posterior estimates of QoIs
  the right column shows respective CATE

each panel visualises the posterior density, posterior median, 95 and 99\% credible intervals

In country specific analysis:
  - Three columns for CATEs of respective QoIs
  - Countries on y axis

due to no variation in CATEs, we further present:
  - expected values by R and T
  - left column T=1 right column T=0
  - y axis country
  - x axis E(Y)
  - visualisation of posterior density, posterior median, 95 and 99\% credible interals

everything separately for dictator and trust game

for reference: an effect of 1 token amounts to 42.55% of standard deviation in the dictator game.

for reference: an effect of 1 token amounts to 40.16% of standard deviation in the trust game.

#### Dictator game

{{< embed code/postproduction/06_figures.qmd#fig-pooled-cov-d >}}

@fig-pooled-cov-d show the pooled results for the dictator game.

AP (row 1):
- Numbers:
  - explicit partisans:
    - median AP 0.99 token
    - ci95: 0.905-1.08
    - ci99: 0.874-1.11
  - implicit partisans:
    - median AP 0.928
    - ci95: 0.746-1.10
    - ci99: 0.684-1.15
  - CATE_AP:
    - median: 0.0669
    - ci95: -0.105-0.244
    - ci99: -0.157-0.299
    - Pr(>0): 77.6\%

- Interpretation:
  - Little evidence of higher AP in dictator game between of explicit partisans: median higher
    - Posterior CATE: given the data, with 77.6\% certainty is there a positive CATE (which would correspond to the theorized expectation)
    - but even then only minor magnitude, 2/3 posterior density mass concentrated below 0.1
    - suggests little to no systematic differences
  - substantially more interesting, implicit partisans show similar level of AP despite reporting no felt attachement to any party
    - more uncertainty for implicit (wider distribution) due to less cases
    - but consistent (with 99\% certainty between 0.68 and 1.15 token, given the data)

IF (row  2):
  - Numbers:
  - explicit partisans:
    - median IF 0.541
    - ci95: 0.456-0.627
    - ci99: 0.427-0.657
  - implicit partisans:
    - median IF 0.447
    - ci95: 0.260-0.638
    - ci99: 0.201-0.7
  - CATE_IF:
    - median: 0.0931
    - ci95: -0.101-0.285
    - ci99: -0.160-0.342
    - Pr(>0): 83.1\%

- Interpretation:
  - Difference slightly more pronounced: 83\% certainty of CATE_IF > 0 (given the data)
  - aligns with expectation
  - but small difference, 77\% of mass > 0 and < 0.25 (given the data)
  - but: overall confident signal of pronounced IF among implicit partisans in dictator game

OD (row 3):
  - Numbers:
  - explicit partisans:
    - median OD 0.453
    - ci95: 0.363-0.541
    - ci99: 0.334-0.574
  - implicit partisans:
    - median OD 0.480
    - ci95: 0.353-0.603
    - ci99: 0.313-0.635
  - CATE_OD:
    - median: -0.027
    - ci95: -0.155-0.0963
    - ci99: -0.191-0.138
    - Pr(>0): 33.4\%
    - Pr(<0): 66.6\%

 - Interpretation:
  - CATE suggests no difference
  - median OD estimate even larger for implicit, contrary to theoretical expectation, but no certain systematic difference
  - still pronounced OD by implicit partisans

#### Trust game

{{< embed code/postproduction/06_figures.qmd#fig-pooled-cov-t >}}

@fig-pooled-cov-t show the pooled results for the trust game.

AP (row 1):
- Numbers:
  - explicit partisans:
    - median AP 1.08 token
    - ci95: 0.998-1.17
    - ci99: 0.968-1.19
  - implicit partisans:
    - median AP 1.08
    - ci95: 0.885-1.26
    - ci99: 0.831-1.31
  - CATE_AP:
    - median: 0.00497 (basically 0)
    - ci95: -0.174-0.191
    - ci99: -0.226-0.252
    - Pr(>0): 51.9\%

- Interpretation:
  - Overall AP basically identical across implicit and explicit partisans,
  as nearly perfectly symmetric CATE distribution around 0 demonstrates
  - Larger uncertainties for implicit, but tendency the same

IF (row  2):
  - Numbers:
  - explicit partisans:
    - median IF 0.625
    - ci95: 0.532-0.723
    - ci99: 0.501-0.756
  - implicit partisans:
    - median IF 0.745
    - ci95: 0.529-0.945
    - ci99: 0.471-1.01
  - CATE_IF:
    - median: -0.121
    - ci95: -0.319-0.09
    - ci99: -0.375-0.158
    - Pr(<0): 86.4\%

- Interpretation:
  - Contrary to theoretical expectation, data suggest tendency of implicit partisans to exhibit higher IF in trust game, as with 86.4\% certainty CATE < 0
  - wider posterior again indicating less observation for implicit types, but still evidence for pronounced IF of implicit types 

OD (row 3):
  - Numbers:
  - explicit partisans:
    - median OD 0.456
    - ci95: 0.375-0.533
    - ci99: 0.354-0.558
  - implicit partisans:
    - median OD 0.332
    - ci95: 0.211-0.455
    - ci99: 0.168-0.496
  - CATE_OD:
    - median: 0.124
    - ci95: -0.008-0.257
    - ci99: -0.046-0.294
    - Pr(>0): 96.6\%

 - Interpretation:
  - CATE suggests systematically higher OD of explicit compared to implicit partisans
  - with 96.6\% certainty, CATE > 0 given the data
  - median CATE suggests roughly 0.12 token less for outpartisans in the trust game by explicit types relative to implicit
  - aligns with hypothesis
  - but again, pronounced and substantial evidence for OD by implicit types

Trust game results serve as reminder that similar levels of AP can arise by symmetrical differences in IF and OD.
Thus importance to disentangle both components when comparing subgroups' AP.

Preliminary conclusion pooled results of both games:
- contrary to the expectations, little evidence of systematically higher AP (or IF and OD) among explicit partisans.
- sometimes direction matches expectation (e.g dictator: CATE_AP, CATE_IF; trust: CATE_OD), but lot of uncertainty remains
- sometimes even opposite tendency (e.g. dictator: CATE_OD; trust: CATE_IF)
- no agreement across games -> further supports interpretation of no systematic differences across implicit and explicit types
- findings provide strong evidence that implicit partisans, despite reporting no attachement to a political party, show similar AP levels, contrary to hypotheses

### Is there context-specific variation?

@fig-country-cov-d-cate show the country specific CATEs for the dictator game.

{{< embed code/postproduction/06_figures.qmd#fig-country-cov-d-cate >}}


- Identical across all countries
- Correspond to pooled CATEs
- If true, suggests no cross-national variation in effect of partian type on AP, IF, and OD

@fig-country-cov-t-cate show the country specific CATEs for the trust game.

same for the trust game:
- Identical across all countries
- Correspond to pooled CATEs
- If true, suggests no cross-national variation in effect of partian type on AP, IF, and OD

{{< embed code/postproduction/06_figures.qmd#fig-country-cov-t-cate >}}

because this feels fishy, and to confidently claim there actually isn't a difference in the partisan type's meaning for AP, IF or OD across countries, we further present the conditional expected values on the basis of which we constructed our substantive QoIs. 

@fig-country-cov-d-ev show the country specific EVs by relationship and type in the dictator game.

Now the pattern clearly shows cross-national variation (i.e. comparing rows) both in terms of baseline token spending (as measured by the tokens to "None"), as well as in terms of AP and its components, which can now be visually inspected (AP as distance between light and dark shaded posteriors, IF as distance between dark shaded and middle shaded posteriors and OD as distance between middle shaded and light shaded posteriors).

However, when comparing columns displaying the posterior expected values by partisan type, there appears no difference in any of the included countries.

For instance, whereas the figure suggests less AP in Ireland than in Spain for instance, the pattern is identical irrespective of partisan type --- implicit partisans from Ireland show less AP than those from Spain --- which explains the identical CATEs across countries.

Differences mainly concern uncertainties, i.e., wider distributions for implicit partisans, but the relative patterns are consistent.

@fig-country-cov-t-ev show the country specific EVs by relationship and type in the trust game.

The trust game figure confirms this conclusion.
Though there are between-country differences visible across rows, comparing types across columns yield identical patterns, differing only in the spread, i.e., uncertainty, of the posteriors, not in their relative locations.  

{{< embed code/postproduction/06_figures.qmd#fig-country-cov-t-ev >}}

While we hypothesized that the effect of explicit partisan attachment might vary by national political context (e.g., party system fragmentation or political culture), our results show a highly consistent pattern. The Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) of explicit partisanship on affective polarization is statistically indistinguishable across all 25 countries, a finding corroborated by the extremely low variance observed in the country-level random slopes for the Partisan Type×Partisan Relationship interaction term (SD\<0.11).

## Robustness

## Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

1. Recap of main empirical finding
  - Across 25 European democracies, and two behavioral games,
    -> explicit partisan attachement does not meaningfully amplify affective polarization
  - CATEs extremely small, posterior mass near zero, often symmetric
  - Implicit partisans exhibit robust AP (IF and OD) despite rejecting attachement

2. Implication 1: Measurement and inference
  - Widespread practice of including leaners / vote anchor respondents is justified for behavioral AP
  - Measuring relying *only* on identifiers risk selecting a shrinking subgroup in many countries
  - Partisan type clarifies when populations of inference shift

3. Implication 2: Theory of partisan identity
  - Explicit identity (PID attachement item) captures only one dimension of partisan identity
  - Behavioral AP seems driven by latent identity, behavioral anchoring, and cue-based expectations more than by self-reported identity intensity
  - Supports @orr2023affective view:
    - identity-like behaviors need not come from identity strensght
  - Supports @campos2025new view:
    - AP is multidimensional; behavioral AP does not cleanly map onto subjective identification

4. Implication 3: Comparative politics
  - Cross-national consistency is notable: the meaning of explicit identification differs across countries, yet its *conditional effect on AP* is remarkably stable
  - Suggests a general mechanism of partisan cue processing operating across democracies
  - Highlights how multi-party systems structure partisan identity differently from U.S. two-party contexts

5. Methodological implications
  - Conjoint experiments allow decomposing AP into IF and OD
  - Design shows how randomization of cues + hierarchical modeling yields strong causal leverage
  - Provides a model for how to estimate AP with heterogeneous partisanship structures

6. Limitations
  - Behavioral AP not equal to all AP (thermometers, social distance, elite affect may differ)
  - Single-item PID measure may be noisy; multiple-item batteries could refine type definitions
  - Cross-sectional study; identity formation dynamics remain open

7. Future research avenues
  - Test whether partisan type matters more for elite evaluations or symbolic identity
  - Explore interactions with ideological extremety or policy sophistication
  - Examine whether partisan type moderates responses to elite cues (vs mass cues)

8. Concluding statement
  - Partisan identity is real, but not reducible to reported subjective attachement alone
  - Implicit partisanship --- the behavioral anchor --- carries enough informational and social content to generate the same AP behaviors as explicit identity
  - This challenges identity-only explanations and strengthens the case for multidimensional- cue-driven models of AP in comparative politics.

### Experimental setup {.appendix}

Before the behavioral games, @hahm2024divided presented respondents a short background information overview and instructions. For the dictator game, these were: *This game is played by pairs of individuals.* *Each pair is made up of a Player 1 and a Player 2.* *Each player will have some information about the other player, but you will not be told who the other players are during or after the experiment.* *The game is conducted as follows: A sum of 10 tokens will be provisionally allocated to Player 1 at the start of each round.* *Player 1 will then decide how much of the 10 tokens to offer to Player 2.* *Player 1 could give some, all, or none of the 10 tokens.* *Player 1 keeps all tokens not given to Player 2.* *Player 2 gets to keep all the tokens Player 1 offers.* *You will play this game three times with three different people.* In the trust game, the provided information and instruction were: *This game is played by pairs of individuals.* *Each pair is made up of a Player 1 and a Player 2.* *Each player will have some information about the other player, but you will not be told who the other players are during or after the experiment.* *Each player will receive 10 tokens.* *Player 1 then has the opportunity to give a portion of his or her 10 tokens to Player 2.* *Player 1 could give some, all, or none of the 10 tokens.* *Whatever amount Player 1 decides to give to Player 2 will be tripled before it is passed on to Player 2.* *Player 2 then has the option of returning any portion of this tripled amount to Player 1.* *Then, the game is over.* *Player 1 receives whatever he or she keeps from the original 10 tokens, plus anything returned to him or her by Player 2. Player 2 receives their original 10 tokens, plus whatever he or she keeps after returning any portion of the tripled amount to Player 1.* *You will play this game three times, with three different people.* *The more tokens you obtain, the more successful you will be.*

In both games respondents were shown a tabular overview of Player 2 after the instructions. @fig-example-profile shows an example of such a profile along with the interface respondents were provided to assign the 10 tokens. Each round, a new profile was displayed to respondents.
